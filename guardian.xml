The financial secretary to the Treasury, Sajid Javid, said Labour had "got their sums wrong". He added: "Their policy would actually cost the public finances more in lost VAT and corporation tax - meaning more borrowing and more debt, exactly what got us into a mess in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But Labour's price freeze is a price con - it would mean rising prices before, rising prices after, and even Ed Miliband says he would break his promise if there is a wholesale price rise during the freeze. That's why hard-working people won't believe Ed Miliband would deliver on his promise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miliband's claims came in a speech given on a tour of the north London constituency alongside his prospective parliamentary candidate, Catherine West, whose main opponent in 2015 will be the incumbent Liberal Democrat MP, Lynne Featherstone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miliband said: "If Labour win the next election, we will freeze energy prices until 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Labour's price freeze will save families an average £120 and an average small business user would benefit by over £5,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But it's not just Britain's families and businesses that would benefit from this price freeze, it's our vital public services too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"New figures today show that if David Cameron put in place our freeze today, public services would save £100m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And that matters more than ever in an era when there's less money around. The NHS is one of our vital national institutions and one of the biggest users of energy. If David Cameron got on and implemented our energy price freeze today the NHS would benefit to the tune of £40m to help it deal with this &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/nov/02/winter-hospitals-crisis-nhs-warning" title=""&gt;winter's A&amp;E crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the equivalent of the salaries of 1,300 nurses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our schools could save £28m, that's the same as the salaries of over 700 teachers. This freeze will happen under the next Labour government."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Leslie MP, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, who compiled the data showing how much government departments would save from an energy freeze, said: "These figures show that it's not only households and businesses that are paying the price for a broken energy market, it's the taxpayer too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need Labour's price freeze and reforms to the energy market - not only to help hard-pressed families, but to spare the taxpayer these higher costs too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/energy"&gt;Energy bills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/consumer-affairs"&gt;Consumer affairs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/household-bills"&gt;Household bills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/energy-industry"&gt;Energy industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/health"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/schools"&gt;Schools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/edmiliband"&gt;Ed Miliband&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/localgovernment"&gt;Local government&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/daniel-boffey"&gt;Daniel Boffey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But now jellied eels, the gelatinous fare that makes even the most enthusiastic omnivore think twice before tucking in, are becoming popular outside the capital for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past two years, sales of jellied eels at Tesco have grown by 35% since the supermarket giant took a gamble and started selling them outside London, including in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The supermarket now sells them in nearly 300 of its stores across the UK – a move that it says would have been unthinkable just five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a major turnaround for a food whose sales plunged during the first decade of this century. The revival is being attributed to a new, more austere environment. "The popularity of jellied eels has taken off during the downturn because shoppers have been looking for inexpensive, nutritious food," said Gary Hooper, a fish buyer for Tesco. "Sales began rising in London and surrounding areas about two years ago, so we decided to take a chance and sell jellied eels further afield."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last time eels underwent such a change in fortunes was during the second world war, when rationing was in place and they were a cheap way of feeding a hungry capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hooper said that he had been surprised that the food was now proving popular outside its traditional home. "I've been in the fisheries business all my life, and until recently no one north of Watford was really interested in eating them," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Jellied eels were always considered a regional dish, much like haggis is to Scotland, mushy peas are to northern England and laver bread is to Wales."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tesco's supplier, Bradley's, based in Eltham, south-east London, distributes 15,000 pots of jellied eels a week to UK retailers. In the past 10 years it has seen UK sales double from 70 tonnes a year to 140 tonnes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frank Bradley, owner of the 67-year-old family business, said the jellied eel trade had been at risk of all but disappearing before the supermarkets started taking an interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Until the early 90s, outside of the few remaining eel, pie and mash houses in London, jellied eels were only really sold on old-fashioned seafood stalls outside pubs," Bradley said. "But with the growth in the 90s of pubs serving food, the stall trade died off, and that might have been the end for the jellied eel trade."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Served either hot or cold, jellied eels are prepared by boiling chopped eels in water and vinegar and then adding lemon, nutmeg and other spices to make a fish stock. The stewing liquid becomes solid and forms a jelly-like substance when cooled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to experts, the dish tastes best with chilli vinegar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eels became a popular food in London during the 18th century – a time when the Thames was so polluted that few actually came from the river. Instead they were brought in by eel barges from Holland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to reports in 2010, eel populations in the Thames had fallen by 98% in just five years. Scientists claimed that the numbers of eels in the river had dropped from 1,500 in 2005 to just 50 in 2010. Today most eels consumed in the UK are imported once again from the Netherlands or Northern Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/fish"&gt;Fish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/food-and-drink"&gt;Food &amp; drink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/food-poverty"&gt;Food poverty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/tesco"&gt;Tesco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/supermarkets"&gt;Supermarkets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jamiedoward"&gt;Jamie Doward&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

With all the coverage generated, hundreds are now expected to attend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those involved in organising the funeral say they have been contacted by veterans' groups and other military supporters keen to acknowledge Percival's career. Percival's plight has been highlighted in local newspapers and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edmund Jacobs, of Roland L Whitehead and Daughter, said: "We're hoping a few faces will turn up and show their support for a war hero. It doesn't sit well with me that somebody who has served their country can be forgotten about, that his service can go un-noted. I am sure he would have had a few stories to tell."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Percival was one of four siblings but lived a "nomadic lifestyle" after leaving the RAF at the end of the war. His nephew, David Worsell, said: "He was a private man, he worked in Australia for a number of years as a decorator and would visit England for holidays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He travelled around England with only his backpack. He didn't have a postal address, he just used to get everything sent to my mother's address and would go through it when they met up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Percival lived in Penge, south London, before joining the RAF. He was based in the north-west of England and became part of the ground crew which helped with the Dambusters, the squadron which was initially formed to destroy dams in the Ruhr valley in Nazi Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After working in Australia, he later retired to England and lived at the Alistre Lodge nursing and care home, in Lytham St Annes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was a distant relative of former British prime minister Spencer Perceval, who was shot dead by a bankrupt broker, John Bellingham, as he entered the House of Commons, in 1812.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matron Janet Wareing said: "Harold was a lovely character, very strong-willed and independent. He was quite a private man, and he loved reading his Daily Telegraph every morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have already been contacted by military veterans who are intending to come, even though they have never met him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've been told one group is looking to bring around 200 people to the service, which would be fantastic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis Boothman, secretary for the RAF Association Layland branch, said he would ring friends and colleagues in an effort to gain additional support. He said: "We normally do try and make a showing at these times. It is important that we remember people like Harold – they are part of us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relative Worsell is unable to attend the service, but his son – Percival's great nephew – will represent the family. Worsell said: "My uncle would be very surprised at the attention this seems to have received and the number of people wanting to attend. What with him being a very private person, forming long-term relationships didn't seem to be part of his make-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He didn't really speak about his military career but he perhaps wished he didn't leave the RAF at the end of the war. But he was a free spirit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The service takes place at 11am on Monday, at Lytham Park crematorium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/secondworldwar"&gt;Second world war&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/military"&gt;Military&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/remembranceday"&gt;Remembrance Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Named "VIP Day" - Very Important Pedestrians - it has been hailed a success by &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheBusStopsHereASaferOxfordStreetForEveryone"&gt;road safety campaigners&lt;/a&gt; and anti-pollution campaigners and West End businesses alike. This year, though, there won't be one. Why? And can we please have it back?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New West End Company (NWEC), which represents businesses in their collective endeavours to &lt;a href="http://www.newwestend.com/about-us/about-us"&gt;promote and improve the area&lt;/a&gt;, says that retailers decided to concentrate their resources on other things this year, notably a collaboration with the British Fashion Council. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lack of a sponsor, following the end of a three-year arrangement with American Express, was a significant factor in the decision - Westminster Council, Transport for London and others all charge for the necessary organisation of VIP Days - which came out of the customary annual review of promotional activities. There is, it seems, at least some debate about how big the sales benefits are. After weighing all pro and cons, VIP was dropped. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NWEC cannot yet say if it will re-appear next year, but stresses that traffic-free events of various kinds will "remain part of the annual mix of event and marketing activity." It also &lt;a href="http://www.newwestend.com/news"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that 2013 has seen the same total number of events with a no-traffic element took place this year as last, drawing particular attention to its "summer Sundays" programme in Regent Street in July. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of those other traffic-free events will take place in the next few days: today (Saturday) most of Regent Street will close to vehicles from early afternoon as part of its &lt;a href="http://www.regentstreetonline.com/Events/Christmas-Lights-on-Regent-Street.aspx"&gt;Christmas Lights Switch On&lt;/a&gt;; next Tuesday, the Selfridges section Oxford Street will do the same from 4:00-8:00 pm for &lt;a href="http://www.viewlondon.co.uk/whatson/oxford-street-christmas-lights-feature-event-4216.html"&gt;further illuminations&lt;/a&gt; to take place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But none of those other events are VIP Days - they lack their scale, their impact and the long glimpses they give of how West End streets might be used differently and better - glimpses of increasing value, perhaps, as the day approaches when Crossrail starts disgorging even more people into what remains London's showpiece retail district. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The West End Commission, which produced its impressive report on the area's future in May, &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-22356722"&gt;recommended an increase&lt;/a&gt; in traffic-free days. And while Westminster councillor Glenys Roberts (Conservative) is pleased there won't be a VIP Day this year - &lt;a href="http://www.westendextra.com/letters/2013/oct/letters-good-news-christmas"&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; that she's glad the NWEC has "taken the advice" she and others resident have provided - the London Assembly displayed rare cross-party unity on Wednesday in unanimously backing a motion calling on Boris Johnson to write to the NWEC to "seek clarification over the future of this popular event."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephen Knight (Lib Dem), who proposed the motion, describes as "daft," "baffling," and "highly regrettable" the decision to not have a VIP Day this year. Stern words. But whatever the reasons for this year's change, it would be good to have it back in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/travel/shopping-trips"&gt;Shopping trips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/london"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/extra/london-south-east"&gt;London &amp; South East&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/travel/london"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/retail"&gt;Retail industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris"&gt;Boris Johnson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/travel/christmas-and-new-year"&gt;Christmas and New Year&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/london"&gt;London politics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/davehill"&gt;Dave Hill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

One of the best organised workplaces in the country, Grangemouth, &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/25/grangemouth-plant-saved-unite-ineos-demands" title=""&gt;suffered one of the worst defeats&lt;/a&gt; of the trade union movement in years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barely a shot was fired. The union was stunned; this wasn't the dispute they thought it was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lured into a limited battle over the witch-hunting of a union organiser, the real stakes were quickly revealed when the boss locked workers out of the plant and threatened to close it down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The union's retreat was humiliating. They conceded everything: pay freezes, an end to final salary pensions, the end of full-time union convenors on site, and no strikes for three years. Employers across the country will look enviously on what Jim Ratcliffe, the billionaire boss of Ineos, has achieved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why did they lose so badly? After all, this was not the first time that Ratcliffe had gone after the final-salary pensions scheme. He was comprehensively &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/01/tradeunions.oil" title=""&gt;defeated in 2008&lt;/a&gt;. His battle with tanker drivers in March this year met with no greater success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it seems that in March Ratcliffe began planning for a new confrontation, and stockpiling oil reserves to see out any strike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The basis for an offensive was provided by the &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/07/falkirk-row-clear-legal-evidence-ed-miliband" title=""&gt;Falkirk controversy&lt;/a&gt;, in which Unite officials were supposedly involved in rigging Labour's selection procedures. It was a candyfloss controversy: mouthwatering, but fuzzy and insubstantial. However, the Labour leadership used it to launch a wide-ranging attack on the union link, forcing the Unite leadership onto the back foot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephen Deans, a Unite representative at the plant and a Labour constituency chair, was initially accused. It was later conceded that he was responsible for no wrongdoing, but Ineos's lawyers used the scandal to justify looking into Deans's company emails to see if he had been using his working time to fight the scandal. They finally &lt;a href="http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/political-news/trade-union-threatens-to-shut-scotlands-only-oil-refinery-over-staff-suspension.21710944" title=""&gt;suspended Deans&lt;/a&gt;, provoking a vote for industrial action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus was the trap laid. The union took their time, beginning with action short of a strike and negotiations. Even when Ineos walked out of Acas negotiations on 15 October, Unite again played cautiously, calling off &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/16/grangemouth-strike-refinery-unite-talks" title=""&gt;planned strike action&lt;/a&gt;. Ratcliffe responded by locking out the workers the next day and &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/16/grangemouth-refinery-closes-dispute-ineos-unite" title=""&gt;shutting down the plant&lt;/a&gt;, imperilling the Scottish economy. This was an employers' strike, not a workers' strike. Instead of workers withdrawing their labour, he withdrew his capital and threatened to withdraw it for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Scottish government would find a buyer for the plant if necessary, but nationalisation was off the agenda. Any private sector buyer would be in a strong position to demand cuts to jobs, as well as pensions and pay. They could make a killing and still be welcomed as a knight in shining armour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's easy to blame union leaders for not being more militant, and usually this sort of criticism rings true. But workers at Grangemouth were not straining at the leash, and nor were any ringleaders ready to push the majority into militant action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Ratcliffe bypassed the union and offered workers a financial inducement to capitulate – 15 grand plus a top-up for their new pensions and relinquishing their right to strike – the union rightly urged workers to reject it, and it seems a majority did. But at least a third signed the new contracts, accepting utter defeat in exchange for a job and an immediate cash boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tactic had played on workers' fear for their short-term future, encouraging them to individualise their calculations: if they lost their jobs, how would their families survive? In such an unpromising situation, who wouldn't look favourably on £15,000 upfront? It's the same desperate logic that leads us to go to payday lenders and loan sharks, knowing full well that immediate relief will be followed by a high cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This signalled the weakening of the union. What had been an overwhelming mandate for strike action was turning into a catastrophic retreat for a significant and growing minority of the workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time the union had conceded the employers' demands and practically begged Ratcliffe to put the deal back on the table, most workers were simply glad to have kept their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neoliberalism has always been, in part, about changing the calculations that people make by altering the balance of incentives and risks in their daily lives, making individual solutions to their problems easier, ruling collectivist solutions – such as nationalisation or secondary picketing – out of bounds. The wider context of stagnation, austerity and the rightward turn of politics has reinforced this. That is how Ineos won.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every workplace is Grangemouth. The same trick can't be pulled twice. But the terrain has just become much more favourable to employers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/tradeunions"&gt;Trade unions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/unite"&gt;Unite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/oil"&gt;Oil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/oilandgascompanies"&gt;Oil and gas companies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/energy-industry"&gt;Energy industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/richard-seymour"&gt;Richard Seymour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

An investigation into the treatment of sick prisoners&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Michael Tyrrell's oldest daughter Ash visited her dying father in hospital and saw him handcuffed and chained to a prison guard, she was so shocked that she took photographs. Tyrrell, who&amp;nbsp;was almost halfway through a 29-year sentence for drug smuggling, had throat cancer and pneumonia. He had lost five stone in weight and barely had the strength to move. He had not been a troublesome prisoner: after 13 years of good behaviour, he was due to be released in 2015. The handcuffs were taken off a few hours before he died the following day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How much of a security risk could a terminally ill, physically weak 65-year-old man really pose?" his daughter Maria, his middle daughter, wrote in an email to the Guardian. "Was it necessary to have him chained up in a way that most of the British public would not think fit for an animal?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyrrell's three daughters believe that his death followed months of inadequate and demeaning treatment by Frankland prison, Durham. A Guardian investigation has revealed that Tyrrell's case is not an exception; that seriously ill and dying prisoners, posing no risk of escape or harm, are regularly cuffed and chained in hospital. The cases also suggest a&amp;nbsp;disturbing pattern of misdiagnosis, substandard treatment and callous disregard for the families of desperately ill prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyrrell was an unapologetic cannabis smuggler. He lived in Antigua, a hippy pothead with a zest for life who was known as the island's first white Rastafarian. He was a cannabis evangelist, who believed it was wrong to deny anybody its healing powers. The young Tyrrell was also an aspiring Formula 3 racer; one of the world's top 70 drivers in his prime. After his sponsor was murdered, he decided to support himself with drug dealing. Always cannabis, he insisted. When the girls were young, he served a sentence in Guadeloupe for smuggling the drug. No complaints: this was his mission, those were the risks he took.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in 2000, he was charged again. But this time it wasn't for cannabis: it was for attempting to import nearly half a tonne of cocaine from Bequia in the Grenadines into Britain. Tyrrell said he had been set up, and that he would only knowingly import cannabis. His daughters say they don't know whether he was telling the truth, but either way, for them, it is now irrelevant. What is relevant, they say, is the way he was left to die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We meet in a pub close to where Ash, works, in Salisbury, Wiltshire. Ash's youngest sister, Ziffy, is over from Antigua. It is barely three months since Tyrrell died and all three daughters are still devastated. Maria, the middle one, was so distraught that she gave up a&amp;nbsp;teaching job in England to return to Antigua. "I&amp;nbsp;have no desire to live in a country run by people who allow this sort of thing to happen," she wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ziffy's eyes are raw from crying. She says most people assume Tyrrell was a terrible father because he spent so long in prison, but that couldn't be further from the truth. He did most of the parenting when they were young, and they&amp;nbsp;remember a childhood full of laughter, jokes and high-speed thrills. Ziffy was only 13 when he&amp;nbsp;went to prison; she says that's when her life fell apart. She believes he was given such a severe&amp;nbsp;sentence because the judge wanted to make an example of him – at the time it was suggested he had made £103m through drug money, a figure that was later downgraded to £2.3m. "Most murderers get less time than he got," she says. "He was the most anti-violent man you could imagine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyrrell had first complained of severe pain after having several teeth extracted in October 2011. He was convinced his mouth had become infected, but the dentist told him there was no infection. The prison doctor then put him on antibiotics – and he remained on them for months. "I'm sorry," Ash says, "how can you do that without referring him to a&amp;nbsp;specialist?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She says he was a loving and sociable rogue, a&amp;nbsp;man who would get on with all sorts. But the more pain he was in, the less sociable he became. "He was saying, 'I don't want to see anybody, my mouth hurts,'" Ziffy says. "I said, 'Why is your mouth still hurting? What's going on?' He said, 'They're ignoring me, they think I'm lying.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyrrell cancelled several appointments with the&amp;nbsp;prison doctors because he had lost faith in them. "He felt if he stopped seeing those 'butchers' he might get a referral to a specialist," Ash says. "He was just being told to take more antibiotics or that there was nothing wrong with him when clearly there was."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time he finally got a referral, Ash says, he was malnourished and dehydrated. He had been living off melted ice-cream because anything else was too&amp;nbsp;painful to swallow, but before long he couldn't even cope with that and was eating a&amp;nbsp;disgusting puree he concocted himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The specialist found a lump on his throat in March, 17 months after Tyrrell had first complained of mouth pain. He was given a biopsy, and diagnosed with terminal throat cancer. "He was told he had a month to live without treatment, between six and 12 months if the treatment began immediately," Ash says. "The oncologist said, 'Why am I&amp;nbsp;seeing you at this late stage?'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Tyrrell became ill, Ziffy says, he was a big man, 18 stone, a&amp;nbsp;life force. "So to walk in and look at this man, my&amp;nbsp;heart broke. Honest to God, broke. I'd look at his legs, and they were half the size of mine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyrrell's family claim that after his diagnosis, the treatment did not begin immediately and he received substandard support. "We asked for a blender so he could buy his own stuff from the canteen and blend it. He died without getting it." Ash says that the prison didn't allow him the pain&amp;nbsp;relief he was due. "The doctors at the hospital said Dad should be getting as much pain&amp;nbsp;relief as&amp;nbsp;he needed, but until I&amp;nbsp;complained, they limited&amp;nbsp;it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Care UK, the private company responsible for health care in Frankland, says it is "unable to release any medical details" before an inquest, but is confident the care they provided Michael Tyrrell was "timely and of a high standard".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyrrell went for hospital treatment five days a&amp;nbsp;week. He was taken in a police van, commonly called a sweatbox. The journey took three hours each way. There was no toilet stop and Ziffy says&amp;nbsp;Tyrrell was told that if he needed to urinate, he should use a plastic bottle, though as he was&amp;nbsp;handcuffed, this would have been impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two months after being diagnosed with throat cancer, Tyrrell was rushed to hospital with pneumonia. When Ash got to see him, she was appalled, not only at how fast he had deteriorated but at the fact that he was handcuffed to a security guard. "It was awful. Absolutely awful. He's got the drip going into his arm, he's got an oxygen mask on, a&amp;nbsp;tube into his chest, and he's handcuffed. The cuff was pushed up to keep out of the way of the drip and bandages. And when they moved it, it cut into his arm." Security guards sat in the tiny room, joking and eating hot food, as Tyrrell lay dying, handcuffed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four days after her father had been admitted, Ash received a phone call at 7.10am. "It was the hospital to say he'd had what they thought was a&amp;nbsp;heart attack, and he wasn't in great shape. They had resuscitated him, but they wouldn't be resuscitating him again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The handcuffs were taken off only after Tyrrell's heart attack. "He died two hours after I&amp;nbsp;got there. The marks from the handcuffs were still there. There were lots of abrasions over his skin," Ash says. "There's no way anybody with a&amp;nbsp;terminal illness should be handcuffed, especially when they're visibly frail." She laughs bitterly at the idea of Tyrrell running away. "He&amp;nbsp;couldn't even prop himself up in that hospital bed. I was pulling him up so he could breathe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Michael Tyrrell, 31-year-old Daniel Roque Hall smuggled drugs. Unlike Tyrrell, he is here to tell his story – but only just. We meet at his mother's house in Kensal Green, west London. Roque Hall, whose father is Nicaraguan, is a bright, handsome man. When he was a child, he was diagnosed with a terrible wasting disease, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedreich%27s_ataxia" title=""&gt;Friedreich's ataxia&lt;/a&gt;, which affects co-ordination and speech; it also causes diabetes and a heart defect that requires constant monitoring. He had a&amp;nbsp;relatively normal childhood, went to a regular school, but by the age of 15 he was confined to a wheelchair. He went to university away from home, studying Spanish and economics, but by then life was becoming increasingly tough as he became more and more dependent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2012, he was arrested for trying to smuggle £300,000 worth of cocaine in the cushion of his wheelchair from Peru through Heathrow. He says he did it only because he was in despair: his condition had started to deteriorate fast, an arranged marriage had been cancelled because his girlfriend's parents didn't want her to marry a&amp;nbsp;man with such poor prospects, and his half-sister had been diagnosed with cancer. Roque&amp;nbsp;Hall, who had no previous criminal record, was in pieces when he was asked to import the cocaine. The judge later accepted that he had been "groomed and manipulated".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once he admitted guilt, it was inevitable that he would be given a custodial sentence. The only thing that could have kept him out would have been if the prison in question, Wormwood Scrubs, had said it was incapable of dealing with his complex needs. Roque Hall's mother, Anne, believes that was what the judge was expecting, and hoping, to hear; then her son would serve his sentence at home under curfew or in care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In court it was made clear that the specialists responsible for his care believed no prison was equipped to look after him. His consultant neurologist told the court about the exercises carers need to do with him through the day and night to palliate muscle pain and constant back pain. He also has to stand in an upright wheelchair six or seven times a day, to maintain what muscle capacity he has. At home, he had at least one carer, often two, 24 hours a day. Anne says the judge looked shocked after Wormwood Scrubs insisted it was perfectly capable of looking after her son. "I jumped up and put myself in front of Daniel when the prison officers came for him, and I said, 'You're not taking him anywhere. I want the governor of Wormwood Scrubs in this court to explain exactly how they are going to look after him because it's a lie and everybody knows it's a lie.' They were all looking at me. In the end I knew I couldn't stop him being taken."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Roque Hall was being processed at the prison, he fell from an examination couch on to his head. He told medical staff he needed to go to hospital after a fall because he was at risk of haemorrhaging, and they suggested he was faking. Instead, he was sent to a care home, where he was surrounded by patients suffering from dementia. Apart from visits to the lavatory, Roque Hall was chained to a&amp;nbsp;prison guard throughout his six days in the care home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was ridiculous," he says slowly, deliberately. Speech is a struggle. "I'm hardly likely to jump out of the window or make a run for it. At one time I went for a shower, so they removed the handcuffs. When I came back, they put the handcuffs on really&amp;nbsp;tight. I said to the lady that they were too tight and they were pinching my skin; I asked her to loosen them and she said, no, that's how it's supposed to be."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roque Hall went into a diabetic coma when in the care home and had to be taken to hospital. A&amp;nbsp;few days later, he was judged well enough to return to Wormwood Scrubs, where it appeared that the jail was not prepared for him. Although a physio was brought in to show staff how to use his stand-up wheelchair, they refused to because they said they had not received adequate training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He lost two stone in seven weeks and suffered dramatic muscle deterioration. While in hospital he had been diagnosed with thyrotoxicosis (caused by an overactive thyroid gland), which can cause severe weight loss. Medical staff at Wormwood Scrubs were told it was vital for his weight to be monitored regularly. "You know how often he was weighed in seven weeks?" Anne asks. "Never. And they actually had a&amp;nbsp;written care plan that said he should be weighed at least once a week."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She looks at her son. "After I saw you there, I&amp;nbsp;just went out and sobbed. I was beside myself." He was rushed into hospital, in chains, on 23&amp;nbsp;August. "When a nurse phoned me about 3am and said he was in intensive care, I&amp;nbsp;simply said, 'Is&amp;nbsp;he dying?' I think she was shocked that I'd said that. She said, well, he's very, very ill. By the time I&amp;nbsp;got down there Daniel was no longer able to speak. He had a whole team of doctors and nurses around him. All he could do was make sounds like 'bleueh bleueh bleueh'. His eyes were terrified. He was emaciated, he had sores on his face, his hair was long. He'd been utterly neglected. What was he doing with sores on his face?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was only when his heart started to give up and he was moved to intensive care that his handcuffs were removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anne, an occupational therapist, finds it traumatic to talk about even now. In the end, Roque Hall did pull through, though he spent the next six months in hospital recovering. His heart consultant said he was in metabolic breakdown, due to the thyrotoxicosis not being monitored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he came out of intensive care, he found himself in a ward surrounded by three prison guards. He and the guards were then moved to a&amp;nbsp;room. His mother says the lack of privacy was obscene. "I was very involved in his care. I gave him his speech therapy exercises, I fed him, so the prison officers saw a lot of me. Some of them said, 'We can't give him the care he needs, he needs to be at home with his people.' But some would make notes when we talked or when the doctors came in." When Roque Hall and his mother spoke to each other in Spanish, they claim the guards forbade it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually it was accepted that Roque Hall could not be rehabilitated with the officers in the room; they were moved outside, with the door left open so they could see everything going on. Before long he was talking and making jokes, Anne says: "And I&amp;nbsp;thought, this is the old Daniel."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, the appeal court showed "exceptional mercy" and ruled that Roque Hall should be released from prison early after his lawyers argued that the Prison Service could not meet his medical needs. "His admission to intensive care and six months in hospital would have been completely avoidable," Anne says, "if they had looked after him as healthcare staff should, and as I&amp;nbsp;would have done at home, and if they had taken action much earlier, not just when he was on the verge of dying."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roque Hall's MP, Glenda Jackson, is horrified that he was handcuffed through much of his ordeal. "It's clearly absurd that a man who could never present a physical danger to anyone should be restrained in this way," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Guardian's findings suggest that restraint is the starting point for most seriously ill prisoners, regardless of privacy and patient confidentiality issues. In May this year, John Twomey was taken from Whitemoor prison in Cambridgeshire to Peterborough hospital to undergo heart surgery. Twomey, 65, is serving 20 years and six months for masterminding a&amp;nbsp;robbery at Heathrow airport. He has had three major heart attacks; after one, at Belmarsh prison, he was pronounced dead and had to be resuscitated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twomey went to hospital in handcuffs, with six guards escorting him. As he was wheeled into the theatre, the heart surgeon said the chain attaching him to an officer would have to be removed. It was pointed out that if his heart needed to be restarted by electric shock, the officer at the other end of the chain would also suffer a shock, possibly severe. The prison staff phoned Whitemoor, asking for permission to remove the chain. It was refused and the operation was cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 30 May, Twomey was taken back to hospital. Following a pre-op and electrocardiogram, the surgeon said she was carrying out an angiogram, and ordered the chain to be removed. Officers remained in the theatre throughout the surgery and replaced the cuffs and chain while Twomey was still on the operating table, despite being told he would be unable to move for several hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2007, Lucy (who doesn't want us to use her last name) was taken from Peterborough prison after suffering a recurrence of a serious gynaecological problem. She was serving a sentence for a non-violent offence and had returned to jail after a&amp;nbsp;day-release on licence. Despite this, she was handcuffed to a male and a female officer on the journey to her hospital appointment. Lucy says she was marched through the hospital reception "jangling like Marley's ghost", and the officers did all the talking. "I wasn't even allowed to confirm my name and date of birth; the male officer repeated my 'address' loudly enough for the whole hospital to hear," she says. She was still attached to both officers when she was called to see the doctor and had to relate her past medical history and current symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was told she would undergo an internal examination and handed a&amp;nbsp;gown. The female officer entered the changing area with her and the male officer, with chain still attached, stood outside. She says that the male officer told the doctor he would have to remain with his prisoner in the small, windowless examination room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was going to have an invasive investigation, one that I wasn't overjoyed at the doctor doing, far less&amp;nbsp;having a strange male observing," she says. In the end the doctor persuaded the male officer to handcuff&amp;nbsp;Lucy to the couch and leave the room, leaving the female officer still attached to her. "The over-the-top security was unnecessary, offensive and inhumane," Lucy says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Prison Service declined to comment on any of the individual cases in this article. It told the Guardian that it restrains severely ill prisoners only after risk assessments have been carried out. "Public protection is our top priority and prison governors have a duty to mitigate the potential risks prisoners pose to the public, medical staff and other hospital users. All prisoners are risk-assessed before being escorted to hospital, to ensure security measures are proportionate and that they are being treated with dignity and respect."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But prisons and probation ombudsman Nigel Newcomen, who published a critical &lt;a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=learning+from+ppo+investigations+end+of+life+care&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=NoFyUs_VFquq7Qba1oGIBg" title=""&gt;report on&amp;nbsp;end-of-life care in custody&lt;/a&gt; this March, is not so&amp;nbsp;sure. "The issue of inappropriate use of restraints on elderly, infirm and dying prisoners is&amp;nbsp;one that needs to be addressed… While the Prison Service's first duty is to protect the public, too often the balance is not achieved between humanity and security. My office has become increasingly robust in stating where this balance hasn't been achieved."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mary Currie has left her old home and moved several times in a&amp;nbsp;desperate attempt to escape her past. Her son, Kyal Gaffney, died in prison in November 2011, three weeks after being convicted of careless driving under the influence. Mary and her daughter Justine have been left trying to put their lives back together, but it isn't proving easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They sit in a living room, surrounded by religious plaques and figurines promising hope and peace, talking about the son and brother who had been an A* pupil at GCSE, with ambitions to be a bilingual lawyer. Then, at 17, his best friend was killed in a car crash. That was when things started to go wrong. Gaffney withdrew from his many friends, became addicted to cannabis, stopped working at school. His A-level results were disappointing and he decided not to go to university. Although he was&amp;nbsp;depressed, he didn't give up entirely. He became a porter, then a&amp;nbsp;healthcare assistant in the hospital Mary worked in as a manager, wrote songs and befriended a boy called Devland Barnes-Bromfield. They soon became inseparable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was 2 July 2010, Barnes-Bromfield's 19th birthday, and Gaffney had been telling Mary all day how they were going to celebrate: they were going to get a taxi to a local club and make a night of it. But late in the evening there was a change of plans and he announced he was going to drive to Leamington, 20 miles away, to pick his mate up from another club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boys didn't stay long: Barnes-Bromfield and his friends had been involved in a minor fracas. Gaffney, one of life's peacemakers, according to his mother, tried to sort it out, had a&amp;nbsp;bottle of cider, chatted up a girl, then the two boys headed off. On the way home, Gaffney hit a tree: Barnes-Bromfield died instantly. Gaffney was left in a coma, and it was a&amp;nbsp;miracle he survived. He severed the main artery in his leg. "He lost enough blood to have killed him," Mary says. "I remember kissing his head, his face held between two blocks, completely splattered in&amp;nbsp;dry&amp;nbsp;blood. His leg wasn't recognisable as a leg."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After an eight-hour operation, he was kept in a medically induced coma for 10 days; he had 11 operations within two weeks of the accident. Gaffney couldn't remember anything of the crash&amp;nbsp;(let alone the fact that Barnes-Bromfield had been lying dead on top of him when he was rescued, which might well have saved his life). When he was told his friend had died, he refused&amp;nbsp;to believe it. "It was like I hit him on the head with two bricks," Mary says. "Then he just&amp;nbsp;let out the most awful noise. It came from right in here." She points to her heart. "It was like&amp;nbsp;a cat being murdered. He was screaming that&amp;nbsp;it should have been him and he didn't want&amp;nbsp;to live. Then he started pulling out the wires."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaffney was initially suicidal, but gradually became positive. He decided he had to make something of his life for his friend's sake. But Barnes-Bromfield's family blamed Gaffney for his death, and wanted to see him prosecuted. Gaffney was charged with careless driving under the influence of alcohol. He was in fact only 0.1ml over the limit after his one bottle of cider. His lawyers told him that if he pleaded guilty, he would be unlikely to face a custodial sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaffney was unwilling to accept that he was over the alcohol limit, but he did tell his mother that he had smoked cannabis that evening. Mary knew then that her son would go to jail. Medical experts argued that he should be allowed to serve&amp;nbsp;his sentence on tag at home. "His doctors said they didn't think he should go to prison because he had everything in place in the community for his medical care. His counsellor actually wanted to put him into the psychiatric unit to protect him from going to prison." Gaffney&amp;nbsp;was sentenced to 21 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mary and Justine are convinced the prison, HMP Hewell in Worcestershire, made everything as tough as possible for him. Mary says that the first time she visited him, he had on only one shoe because the prison had not given him his surgical footwear. He was struggling to walk on his crutches and was told he had to climb three flights of stairs to get his pain relief. "And the prison officer is there saying, come on, you can do it faster than that. We found out afterwards, to&amp;nbsp;add insult to injury, that there's a lift&amp;nbsp;in his block." On her first visit, Gaffney complained to his mother of cold, and said he was bunged up. By her second visit, she was worried about his condition. Like Michael Tyrrell, he was prescribed pain relief, to be topped up when necessary – but she says he was denied the top-up and was in agony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem was that Gaffney would not admit just how severely disabled he was. "He told me not to make a fuss," Mary says. "He didn't want to appear to be a wuss. I'd phoned in the week, asked to speak to healthcare, and they wouldn't let me because Kyal was over 18, so they just put me through to the chaplaincy. He looked really poorly on the second visit, and I was concerned because his nose had been bleeding and he'd been bringing up blood for five days. "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mary and Justine made one final visit&amp;nbsp;to Kyal, on 4 November 2011. "I was absolutely appalled," Mary says. She does slow breathing exercises – three inhalations followed by heavy exhalations – to&amp;nbsp;control her emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I couldn't believe my eyes," Justine says. "He just looked completely white, and all you could see was this massive bruise on his forehead. We didn't even say, 'Hello, how are you?', just, 'Oh my God, you've been beaten up." But he hadn't been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As he started talking, we could see his tongue looking as if it had blood blisters on it," Justine says. "We thought he'd been hit from the back, had hit his head and bitten his tongue. He said, 'No, I had a nosebleed last night and I woke up with all these things on my tongue.' He rolled up his sleeve and he had a massive bruise on his arm.&amp;nbsp;He was really disoriented and his eyes looked glazed. To start with I thought he'd been smoking weed again. I cried all the way home after the visit. I just had this feeling I wasn't going&amp;nbsp;to see him again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I phoned the prison when we got home," Mary&amp;nbsp;says. "By this time the chaplaincy had gone and I said, with the greatest respect, it's not&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;spiritual matter, it's a medical matter. And they said, well, the chaplaincy deals with it and they're not here now, so you'll have to get in touch with them tomorrow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four days later, Gaffney was diagnosed with leukaemia and rushed into hospital. Again there were vital delays: his blood was taken in the morning but not tested till the evening. He was in an observation room from 9.45pm to 2am, bleeding from his nose. He had suffered a cerebral haemorrhage. All this time he was handcuffed to a prison guard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 2.15am he became unconscious. "He was in the last hours of his life and they just put him in an observation room with a brown sick bowl, and left him to die," Mary says through a&amp;nbsp;cascade of tears. He was clinically brain dead, still handcuffed to a prison guard. It was only when doctors insisted that the chains be taken off for a CT scan, that they were removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They phoned me up at 3.45am and told me that Kyal had been taken to hospital," Mary says. "I said, oh, we're due to visit him later, will we be able to see him in hospital?" She breathes in deeply. "I asked what was wrong and the man from the prison said, 'You need to go to the hospital, his pupils have blown.'" They really expressed it like that? "Yes. If I wasn't a medical-type person, I wouldn't have known what it meant. But I did know: it means you've bled in your brain." She swallows and breathes. "When we got there, we were taken into a little office and this doctor came and asked us all to sit down."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years on, Mary still finds it hard to believe, let alone talk about, what she witnessed. The doctors thought there was one last chance to save her son, by rushing him for emergency surgery at a more specialised hospital. "They needed a&amp;nbsp;doctor and two nurses in the ambulance, but the guards insisted they had to go with him, and there wasn't room."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I said, 'You should be ashamed of yourselves,'" Justine says. "My brother needs to get in that ambulance, and you are having an argument with medical staff because you want to get in there. He's in a coma and you still think you need to stop him escaping?" In the end, the medical staff agreed to travel with just one nurse and the two guards, but by then it was too late. It was now 6am, four hours since Gaffney had gone into a coma, and doctors decided nothing could be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indignity was heaped upon indignity. Around 30 friends arrived to say goodbye to him before the life-support machine was turned off. "The&amp;nbsp;guards didn't leave the room till after we&amp;nbsp;arrived," Justine says. "They wouldn't allow any of his friends to go in because technically he was still a&amp;nbsp;prisoner. The guards were still there even when the machine was turned off. We said, 'We don't need you here now, you know he's dead. Is that not enough for you?'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kyal Gaffney died, aged 22, on November 9 2011.&amp;nbsp;The inquest into his death heard a&amp;nbsp;catalogue of misdiagnoses and unnoticed symptoms, and an occasion when the prison doctor refused to see him. A narrative verdict concluded: "There&amp;nbsp;were a number of missed opportunities for further intervention prior to 7 November 2011. The jury concludes that had further intervention occurred, then it is more likely than not that an intracerebral haemorrhage could have been avoided." In April, a &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-22254354" title=""&gt;report into HMP Hewell&lt;/a&gt; by HM Inspectorate of Prisons concluded that the jail "provided an unsafe and degrading environment".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask most prisoners what their main fear is and they will tell you it is getting ill in jail – a&amp;nbsp;fear that seems to have been exacerbated by the privatisation of healthcare services in prison and the impending withdrawal of legal aid for prisoners to challenge neglect by prison staff. While the cases examined here are extreme, the charity &lt;a href="http://www.inquest.org.uk/" title=""&gt;Inquest&lt;/a&gt; believes they are indicative of common failings in prison healthcare. Deborah Coles, co-director of Inquest, says: "This demonstrates a shocking abuse of power, and a&amp;nbsp;total lack of humanity towards dying, seriously ill and disabled prisoners. These are not isolated cases but illustrative of a systemic pattern where principles of humanity and decency have been usurped in the interests of security, and where the use of restraints is the default rather than the exception. Such policy interpretation must be urgently reviewed to prevent further ill-treatment and to ensure restraint is used only in the most exceptional circumstances."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in Salisbury, Michael Tyrrell's daughters are convinced that if he had been diagnosed earlier, he would still be alive. They point to a&amp;nbsp;photograph of a cheerful, larger-than-life man happily listening to the Salvation Army in prison, taken just a few months before he died. But for now this is not the way they remember him. The image they are left with is of an emaciated man lying in a hospital bed, chained to a prison guard, waiting to die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/prisons-and-probation"&gt;Prisons and probation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/law/criminal-justice"&gt;UK criminal justice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/ukcrime"&gt;Crime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/health"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/ericallison"&gt;Eric Allison&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/simonhattenstone"&gt;Simon Hattenstone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

They didn't expect the burglar to move in…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1970s my parents, Murdoch and Rosalind Mitchison, built their dream home on an abandoned estate in East Lothian, about 15 miles south of Edinburgh. It had everything you could wish for: a&amp;nbsp;ruined dower house, a wood with an old chapel, a&amp;nbsp;walled garden, landscaped pastures, a folly, even an ancient yew tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murdoch and Rosalind brought in an adventurous young architect who duly designed them an adventurous house – an L-shaped bungalow with a light tower and a pond that went inside the house, and doors everywhere out on to their wonderful garden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the problems with the house quickly became apparent. The light tower turned into a graveyard for flies, and the innovative garden pond was a conduit for pure Scots cold. But my parents didn't care. They ignored the flies and blocked up the pond every autumn. And they loved their bungalow. It had everything they wanted: views over fields, a large, tree-filled garden, a proper-sized larder where my mother stockpiled jam and my father stored his crates of wine and spirits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My parents' life was most convivial. My father was a great conversationalist and they were generous hosts, the tables laden with fruit, salty snacks and a basket of chocolate bars. The bookcase by my father's chair was fitted out with a spectrum of malt whiskies and interesting armagnacs. Pinned to the front door was a&amp;nbsp;handwritten card. "Come in and shout," it said. And that's exactly what their friends did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few others popped in, too. For a while my parents noticed a mystery intruder was removing fruit from their kitchen table – it turned out to be mice. And then, a gilt baroque clock disappeared. But neither of my parents seemed unduly concerned, and indeed Murdoch felt quite gratified because the thieves had overlooked his priceless Chinese grave figure, which was a horrible little terracotta man with weird protruding nipples that lived on the drinks&amp;nbsp;bookcase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so the years rolled by and the shrubs grew up round the house. In 2002, my mother died after a stroke and my father was left on his own. By 2007 Murdoch, in his mid-80s, was frail and barely able to walk. His mind was usually sharp – very sharp – but his spirits were uncertain. And&amp;nbsp;he was lonely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One morning Murdoch's housekeeper, Jean, noticed the television digibox had vanished. Murdoch padded round the house making more unwelcome discoveries. His cash had gone, and his credit cards. He looked in the drawer in the study – were there fewer keys than before? He wasn't sure. And then the filing cabinets. He didn't seem able to find some documents, including a list of the valuables for his insurance company. And the stock of wine and spirits had been thinned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the following days, on at least two occasions, more money, more drink and a few small electrical items were removed. Clearly there was&amp;nbsp;a burglar making regular visits. In fact, he&amp;nbsp;was treating the house as if it were his own. He&amp;nbsp;helped himself to the chocolate bars, leaving the wrappers on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next couple of weeks, my father phoned the police repeatedly. He didn't get much joy. A burglar who stole only small quantities of cash and cruised the chocolates didn't seem to impress them. They made a few visits, but no offender was apprehended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some elderly people would have been terrified.&amp;nbsp;But Murdoch was made of sterner stuff. He was annoyed by the break-ins – it was a bother and an inconvenience, and he hated having to lock his front door, which really meant locking out his friends, and locking out the emergency services if he fell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he was also intrigued. Murdoch was by nature curious – he had been a research scientist all his life. He always liked to find out how things&amp;nbsp;worked. Now that the front door was locked, how was the burglar getting in? And who was he anyway?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One evening in October my phone rang in Bristol. It was 6.10, which was our normal chat time, when the evening telephone tariffs came in. He'd be in his chair, G&amp;T in his hand, the Chinese grave figure leering down on him, the curtains still open on to the view of silver birches and the fields beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's been again," said Murdoch firmly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's he taken?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just money," he replied. "I put £10 in a wallet and left it on the dining room table."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You what?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just to see," said Murdoch coolly. "I wanted to know if he'd take it. And he has."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spoke to one of my sisters. She was furious about the lack of police response. Murdoch was old, disabled, vulnerable. Why were there no surveillance cameras? What about an alarm? Had&amp;nbsp;anyone searched the woods? And why hadn't the house been properly fingerprinted? The police, she said, weren't even trying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But he's not frightened," I said. "He's even started conducting experiments. He's laying bait for the burglar."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's not the point," said my sister. "What if he meets the burglar? What if Murdoch gets knocked over and breaks a hip."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My sister is a doctor. Breaking a hip, she explained, was often a turning point for old people. Some never really recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I flew up to Scotland for the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday morning, PC Murray Cairns visited. He was a nice man, discreet, sympathetic and, on this occasion, a bit stunned. He said nothing when he saw the vast unlocked larder full of drink, and the two boxes of Gordon's gin stacked in the front hall. He nodded politely when Murdoch explained that, as he didn't go out much, he liked to keep a good supply of cash in the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We went round the outside – checking the front door, the back door, the conservatory door, the pantry door, the four sets of french windows with light metal frames. Showing Cairns round, watching that silent blink, was instructive. I saw my father's circumstances in a new and most unwelcome way. For any petty burglar, the house, so secluded and so cash- and drink-filled, was a&amp;nbsp;ripe plum. The burglar had eight doors to choose from. And everywhere trees, tall bushes, secret paths – nobody would see you but the goldfish. And if someone chanced to come up the drive – we were at least a mile from the road –&amp;nbsp;there were the woods nearby and the ruins of the old dower house: a quick get‑away would be so easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as for Murdoch, a burglar couldn't hope for&amp;nbsp;more. He was an old man, sedentary, predictable in his habits and crippled by arthritis. In his prime Murdoch had walked the Alps, and the Eildon hills of the borders. Now watching him made you want to weep – he moved like King Kong. There would be no chases; the burglar could come and go as he pleased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, I walked around my father's garden. At the back of the bungalow lay the ruins of the old dower house. I walked up the magnificent stone steps into the first "room" of the ruin, where my father had planted shrubs and put down a small path with a seat at the end. There were paper tissues scattered near the seating area and, leaning against a wall, was a bicycle. I was looking at it, wondering how on earth it got there, when an angry voice came from behind me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's ma bike!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I turned. There, holding a large piece of cardboard, was a sallow, dark-haired young man with a long lantern jaw and terrible acne. I&amp;nbsp;muttered something apologetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he glowered on: "Ma bike!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then he started to speak at length in very broad Scots. I was completely floored. All I could pick out were a few words. Something about a&amp;nbsp;"wasp's nest". He showed me an ineffectual little fire he'd made under a tree. He started to fan the fire with the piece of cardboard, but it was a&amp;nbsp;wet autumn day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I walked back to the bungalow. I made a&amp;nbsp;cup&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;tea in the kitchen and mused about this&amp;nbsp;odd encounter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why on earth had I ended up apologising? The man wasn't only trespassing, he had taken possession. It was almost as if he owned the ruin, not us … And then it dawned on me. I had seen our burglar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I nipped outside again. The little fire was out. The man and his bike had gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday night the burglar came again. He also popped round to my father's neighbour, Ulrich, and relieved him of his camera and some foreign currency. On Monday morning, Jean saw a dark-haired man behaving suspiciously near the ruins. I&amp;nbsp;telephoned the police to tell them that both Jean and I had seen the burglar. I described him and offered to identify him and make a&amp;nbsp;statement. But&amp;nbsp;the police said they already had a suspect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That night the burglar dropped in on Murdoch again. Maybe not "dropped in". "Came to stay" was a better description. The man rifled through the filing cabinets in the study, went into my father's bedroom and stole coins from his trouser pocket. I'm not sure whether, on that occasion, the burglar helped himself to a drink in the sitting room, but he certainly tried out the salty snacks. He didn't like the wasabi peas and spat them out across the carpet. Then, it seems, he had a kip in the spare bedroom. He left behind a toothbrush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jean came the following day. The spare bedroom bed was all crumpled and used. Had&amp;nbsp;he really slept the night there, or had the bed been unmade before? She wasn't sure. But then somebody had smoked a cigarette in the bathroom at the far end of the house – she could distinctly smell it. And someone was definitely hanging out in the ruins – here Ulrich's family found their foreign coins, soiled tissues, a cigar box, a syringe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murdoch called the police, Ulrich called the police, I called the police. Again and again. But it was like grasping at air. It soon became clear that many of the burglaries Murdoch reported were not being logged. And if they were logged, the cases were assigned to different officers. Burglary number CR/0083404/07 was being dealt with by PC Cairns. But burglary CR/085409/07 was under the care of DC Higgenbottom. And Higgenbottom was away on annual leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So who was Murdoch to talk to? There were the police based in Tranent who were meant to cover the area where my father lived. Meanwhile the housebreaking team, an entirely separate entity, worked out of Dalkeith. Then there were the forensics specialists, the home-security advisers, victim support…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The individual police were normally charming, but collectively they were a shower. After about a&amp;nbsp;month of nothing happening, I brought an official complaint. Eventually a reply arrived on splendid stationery with a watermarked coat of arms featuring two white lions rampant. Deputy chief constable Thomas Halpin wrote, "I&amp;nbsp;apologise that on this occasion in your dealings with Lothian and Borders police you felt the need to complain." An apology letter utilising the verb "to feel" is not an apology. We were on our own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The break-ins continued. We did some more barricading of the house, locking off the bottom wing of the bungalow, putting sections of wood in the runners of the french windows to block them. Some locks were replaced. My father had a&amp;nbsp;keypad fitted on the front door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But nothing changed. The slow, sly little raids continued. Sometimes he'd prise open a french window and there would be muddy footprints, maybe a dirty towel in one of the bathrooms, and something obviously missing. Other times it was a quick in-out for cash and a bottle. Sometimes we were still baffled how he'd got in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The police officially logged 12 burglaries in the first three years, but there were many, many more break-ins that we reported. We didn't keep a tally but Jean, who came three times a week to clean the house and care for Murdoch, remarked that there were times when she felt the burglar was coming more often than she was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jean even met the burglar on the bus and later we discussed the protocol. What do you say? Should you confront him? And once, coming up to the front door, she saw a hand with a cigarette hanging languidly out from one of the walls of the ruin. She phoned the police, but by the time they came he had snuck off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually the police shook themselves awake. One day I received a call from Dalkeith police station. They wondered if I would be able to come and identify the man I had seen in the ruin. That Saturday, I visited Dalkeith police station. I brought along my younger son, Ted, then aged about 11. He was thrilled at the prospect and I felt that at least somebody in our family should get some pleasure from this wretched affair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the station, two very friendly plain-clothes officers brought us into a small, windowless room. Ted sat by my side chirping, "Can we see the prisoners? Can we see the jail?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I looked through a booklet of male mugshots. I looked. I looked again. It was harder than I&amp;nbsp;expected. Then, from the sea of faces, the burglar suddenly emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's him," I said, pointing at the lantern jaw, the spots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Who? Let's see! Let's see!" said Ted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The policeman whipped the book away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Did I get it right?" I said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We couldn't possibly comment," said one of the officers. But their faces were wreathed in smiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we all knew who the burglar was. And the police, on their various hopeless visits, filled in the picture a little more. They gave up being discreet. We talked about the burglar by name. He suffered from a drug problem and lived in a local small town. He apparently had a&amp;nbsp;girlfriend and a small child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet the police still didn't act. Repeatedly Murdoch was told they had insufficient evidence to secure a conviction. Even trails that seemed pretty clear to us – for example, my father's stolen cheques being cashed by the burglar's girlfriend's sister – were not apparently enough to nail him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I wondered if we were being overcritical. We weren't police. We didn't know the problems they faced. But then my niece Stephanie, who is a policewoman, visited. She wandered around Murdoch's house in plastic gloves. She found an earprint against the outside of the glass of the most recently broken into french window. Outside, she&amp;nbsp;picked up two silver&amp;nbsp;spoons belonging to the house. In the ruins&amp;nbsp;she collected some shitty tissues, from which DNA&amp;nbsp;could be extracted. She went to the&amp;nbsp;local police with her evidence and with news&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;the earprint. But we heard nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is astonishing is the length of time this situation persisted and how casual and "at home" the burglar became. On the part of the police, it was a mixture of ageism and failure of imagination. They never did seem to realise how corrosive cumulative petty crime can be for the old and vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And how did Murdoch take it? Sometimes he was really rattled. Other times he joked that the burglar added drama and interest to his life. My father wasn't a greedy man or materialistic. He'd never liked money much and wasn't interested in it – so losing some funds was not the end of the world. He was pretty redoubtable; he wasn't even spooked by the burglar snooping on him from the garden. Murdoch didn't sit quaking in his chair thinking "what if". The what-iffing was left to the rest of us – his children and his friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the burglar impinged on my father's life in so many ways. Firstly, he undermined his basic belief in the fairness of civil society – weren't the police meant to be there to protect you? Also, because apparently nothing could be done about&amp;nbsp;the burglar, everyone's attention turned to&amp;nbsp;Murdoch. All sorts of elements of his life and his open-handed hospitality were called into question. Why didn't he gear up and buy CCTV cameras? (He considered them outrageously expensive.) Why did he keep so much drink in the house? (It was one of his last&amp;nbsp;remaining pleasures.) Why were the curtains&amp;nbsp;open at night? (It's hard to close curtains&amp;nbsp;when you walk with a stick.) And anyway, shouldn't Murdoch be living somewhere less cut-off? The implication was that the burglaries were his fault.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a subtler, more insidious side-effect, too. Murdoch was not a chaotic man, but he was getting older and more forgetful. The normal fixtures of reality – what was where and when –&amp;nbsp;began to slither in his mind. Murdoch would wake in the morning and find that £30 had gone from his wallet. Or had he spent it? Was he sure? Did he believe himself? Did we believe him? Did he believe that we believed him? Did&amp;nbsp;we believe that he believed that we didn't believe him? And&amp;nbsp;so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The police did finally get the burglar, and it was partly thanks to Murdoch's love of a good drink. One of his regular purchases was the Wine Society's blended scotch whisky. In fact he was the only Wine Society customer in East Lothian at that time who was buying this whisky. The police raided the burglar's flat and found bottles of the Wine Society's blended scotch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually the police felt they had a sufficiently large body of evidence and the burglar was arrested and duly charged. Murdoch, Jean, Ulrich and I were all called as witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the day of the court hearing, we sat in the waiting room at Haddington sheriff court. Murdoch was in good spirits – he had been looking forward to the courtroom drama for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then came a long wait. I got talking to a&amp;nbsp;young woman sitting opposite – she worked in the office of a local building company. For quite some time the builder had complained of remarkably high fuel bills. Then one day she saw our burglar siphoning out diesel from one of the lorries. A woman nearby joined in the conversation. She, too, had been burgled repeatedly. After a while an elderly man spoke of his burglaries. Gradually a picture built up. Our burglar, like a&amp;nbsp;provincial judge, had a circuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, a court official appeared and instructed us all to go home. The burglar had apparently changed his plea to guilty. He had ruined Murdoch's Grand Day Out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There followed a very nice period of respite. He was inside. Everyone could relax. But the break didn't last. If I recall correctly, it was a matter of months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One evening, just after six, the telephone rang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's back!" said Murdoch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After his spell at Saughton prison our burglar bounced back, wilier and more determined. He had a new technique with the french windows and used a bit of wire to fish out the blocks of wood and prise open the doors. He never did us the favour of removing the horrible little Chinese man, but he penetrated Murdoch's safe, removing antique coins and medals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He stole Murdoch's computer twice and this was the cruellest blow. It caused my father more misery, distress and impotent rage than anything else. Replacing a computer always seems to entail an upgrade. After a gargantuan struggle, Murdoch mastered the first new batch of computer software. But, the second time round, and my father was 87 by this time, he felt thoroughly defeated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And by then the end was near anyway. Murdoch fell and broke his hip. He did it without the assistance of the burglar – the one time that wretched snoop could have been of some use and called 999 for us, he was elsewhere. The broken hip, as my sister predicted, was disastrous. From then on my father was confined to a&amp;nbsp;wheelchair and lived in a care home until he died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Murdoch's funeral, I made a speech welcoming my father's many friends and relations. I pointed out that one person most persistently present in Murdoch's life, one of his most constant companions, was missing – the burglar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That wasn't the end of it. The burglar hit back with a final posthumous raid. This time he went the whole hog, smashing down two doors, rolling back the garden fence and driving a&amp;nbsp;car up to the house to carry away all the remaining alcohol. He made a night of it, and slept in the spare room bed; he always was the most intimate of thieves •&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/ukcrime"&gt;Crime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/older-people"&gt;Older people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/housing"&gt;Housing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/amanda-mitchison"&gt;Amanda Mitchison&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

By the end, she had made more sense of her family – especially her grandmother – and of herself&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the autumn of 1913, a handsome boy of 15 had just left school in London and gone to boarding school in Heidelberg to improve his German. His father was German and he had a large extended German Jewish family. Jack's exuberant letters home tell of his escapades: toboganning, skating and practical jokes on the teachers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within two years, the outbreak of war had transformed this schoolboy into a young officer (he lied about his age to enlist) and a few weeks after he arrived in France he was dead, killed in the battle of the Somme. His German cousin was killed in the same battle, fighting on the other side. Two years later, his clever older brother, Norman, was also dead. Their little sister Nancy, my grandmother, was devastated along with the rest of her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the kinds of stories that thousands of families have buried in their history and as the centenary of the first world war arrives next year, there will be four years of public commemorations. But it's the personal significance, the emotional weight of this all too common tragedy that has drawn me into a compelling journey over the last two years. Each family can tell its own story of how it has carried that grief over the last century and how it has shaped characters and relationships in succeeding generations. Many of those stories are lost and hard to piece together. But completely unexpected for me was the power of the story of these two young men and their bereaved family, and how it resonated with me – making more sense of my grandmother, but also of myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It began with reading a shoebox of letters from Norman and Jack, which my grandmother had kept for more than 80 years. There were more than 150, some on smart, headed paper, some on notebook pages, written with stubs of pencil. They start with Jack's schoolboy pranks in Heidelberg in late 1913 and end with Norman's last letter in March 1918, asking for a copy of Shelley and assuring his anxious mother that his posting in the trenches "has become almost a fairy bower and is approached by rustic arches and surrounded by flower beds".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What sprung off the pages were two vivid and distinct characters. Jack is the impatient and quick-witted one, poking fun at his dull German cousins but enjoying the cakes they sent. He revels in the idiosyncrasies of his teachers, baiting them to the delight of his classmates. He is deeply affectionate to his parents, assuring them that he kisses their photograph at night "even if there are people watching" and including messages to his two younger sisters. As he embarks on army training, his eager bravado is palpable and he opts to join the machine gun corps – "They call it the suicide club," he writes airily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At last, in January 1916, the waiting is over and Jack is leaving his training camp "for an unknown destination"; he has been put in charge of four machine guns, yet is short of his 18th birthday. He issues instructions home for new boots, a waterproof sheet, a lamp, field glasses and a camera. The constant requests from the two brothers for supplies – cakes, butter, razors, soap, blankets, mouth organs and books – must have entailed dozens of shopping trips and hundreds of parcels over the four years of war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1916, Jack wrote to Norman, then in Gallipoli: "Tonight I am going up [to the front] to stay for some time and tomorrow we are going to end the war, at least we think so, and my division is in the firing line. At present it is rather rotten up in the trenches because they keep on retaliating against our bombardment with beastly heavy stuff. Our trench mortars are wonderful things. I don't know if you had any of the football variety in Gallipoli but you should see the mess they make of the Hun's wire, it simply rolls it up and lays it aside." He died the following day. His sergeant wrote to his parents to praise Jack's remarkable courage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norman's letters, by contrast, are long and descriptive as he writes of his experiences in three theatres of war – Gallipoli, Egypt and France – between 1915 and 1918. He gives vivid accounts of the utter chaos of &lt;a href="http://www.gallipoli-association.org" title="Gallipoli"&gt;Gallipoli&lt;/a&gt; where he shelters under flimsy awnings in shallow holes in the ground, exhausted and starving. In Egypt he is restless, bored by the remote posting and agitated that he might never experience the glory of battle. Finally, he is in Flanders and recounts horrific battles where he struggles with the mud, rats and deafening roar of the guns. On one occasion, he is stranded in no man's land for days and watches the wounded groaning where they lie. Interspersed with accounts of the trenches are affectionate notes to his younger sisters and his nanny, with cartoon drawings, jokes and promises of presents. Threaded through the letters is a constant attempt to care emotionally for his family at home, with reassurances and anecdotes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During quieter periods, Norman talks of the books and magazines he is reading and the essays he is trying to write; he writes of poetry, music, politics, art, philosophy, religion and ideas. Gradually disillusionment sets in; in 1916 he talked of Jack's noble death but within 18 months he has become bitterly angry at Beaverbrook's warmongering Times and lambasts the incompetence of the generals and the politicians. By 1918, he is calling for a revolution in England such as Russia has just experienced. Towards his own life, he develops a chilling fatalism and requests that on his gravestone they engrave: &lt;a href="http://quotes.dictionary.com/tis_all_a_chequerboard_of_nights_and_days" title="Tis all a chequer-board of nights and days/Where destiny with men for pieces plays."&gt;"Tis all a chequer-board of nights and days/Where destiny with men for pieces plays."&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a photograph of my grandmother as a teenager in the aftermath of her brothers' death; she seems frozen with a deep, unspeakable sadness. She grew up to be a charismatic but brittle woman; she was a tyrannical mother and only softened as a grandmother in late old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But alongside this emotional legacy of tragedy was another, more concrete, commemoration. My great-grandparents decided after the first world war to fund a health clinic for children in the then dire slum of Highgate New Town, in north London, in memory of their sons. It would be for minor operations, convalescence and general outpatient services. It was in operation for 40 years until it was handed over to Camden council in 1967; now the Konstam Family Centre, it has been a nursery ever since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year ago, my mother and I went to visit the clinic into which her grandparents had poured their grief. It's a large, handsome building and in the hallway a bronze plaque commemorates the lives of Norman and Jack; the staff had put poppies in the small vase. Old photos were produced, showing the two wards named after Norman and Jack; framed photos of them stood on small tables in the centre of the ward with a vase of flowers – a form of secular shrine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I detected the hands of both my great-grandparents. Photos of the boiler room, operating theatre and sluice room spoke of my great-grandfather's practicality and attention to detail; the beautiful Indian flowered bedspreads and carved wooden furniture spoke of my great-grandmother's flamboyant taste. She was a dedicated volunteer at the clinic until her death in the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the main revelation was the visitor's book. After the clinic opened in 1924, page after page lists the paediatricians, public health officials and politicians who came from all over the world – Siam, Russia, China, Latin America, the US and Europe. Until the outbreak of the second world war, the clinic was a pioneering model of child healthcare. It was riding a wave of new understanding about the importance of public preventive health, in particular for children whose lives could be unnecessarily blighted by poor health care. It was projects like this clinic that paved the way for the postwar NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've tracked the story through old ledgers of council minutes and given talks to local history societies where former pupils of the Konstam nursery expressed appreciation of my great-grandparents' generosity, but the most moving point of the two-year odyssey was when my nephew and a friend did a reading of Jack and Norman's letters in a local theatre. Eighty of the surviving family gathered to remember these young men; among those present were six of their nieces and nephews, including my mother. This act of remembrance felt long overdue. And now I find myself thinking of Norman, Jack and their parents frequently; it is as if I have finally met relations – to whom I owe so much – that I have always half-known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/family"&gt;Family&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/firstworldwar"&gt;First world war&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/remembranceday"&gt;Remembrance Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/grandparents-and-grandparenting"&gt;Grandparents and grandparenting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/bereavement"&gt;Bereavement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/madeleinebunting"&gt;Madeleine Bunting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Like thousands of men of their generation, two of Madeleine Bunting's great-uncles – Norman and Jack Konstam – died in the first world war when they were little more than boys. In their memory, their parents set up and funded a pioneering free clinic for children in a deprived part of north London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/madeleinebunting"&gt;Madeleine Bunting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.theguardian.com/c/34708/f/663877/s/337b258b/sc/10/mf.gif' border='0'/&gt;&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180263869428/u/0/f/663877/c/34708/s/337b258b/sc/10/rc/1/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180263869428/u/0/f/663877/c/34708/s/337b258b/sc/10/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180263869428/u/0/f/663877/c/34708/s/337b258b/sc/10/rc/2/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180263869428/u/0/f/663877/c/34708/s/337b258b/sc/10/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180263869428/u/0/f/663877/c/34708/s/337b258b/sc/10/rc/3/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180263869428/u/0/f/663877/c/34708/s/337b258b/sc/10/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180263869428/u/0/f/663877/c/34708/s/337b258b/a2.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180263869428/u/0/f/663877/c/34708/s/337b258b/a2.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/180263869428/u/0/f/663877/c/34708/s/337b258b/a2t.img" border="0"/&gt;</description>

Those include a group of hedge funds, led by the US-based Silver Point and Aurelius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 12,800 or so retail investors hold "perpetual subordinated bonds" (known as Pibs) or preference shares, and this week, as part of the new proposals, they have been offered improved terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many had bought the bonds to provide a secure retirement income – they offered annual interest ranging from 5.5% to 13% – and some had formed an action group to fight the original plans to offer them shares in the bank. They have now been offered an alternative that will still leave them out of pocket, but by much less than many originally feared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holders of the 13% bond will be offered a choice of continuing the 13% income a year until 2025, but losing all their underlying capital, or getting 9.2% a year until 2025 and 84% of their capital back. A similar deal is on offer to 9.25% preference shareholders, while investors with the 5.5% bonds will be offered a new bond paying 5.8% a year, but will lose nearly half of their underlying capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bond expert Mark Taber of the Co-op Bank Retail Investors Campaign says the outcome is the best small investors could have hoped for. "This deal has been extremely hard-fought and is now a much better solution for retail holders and pensioners. It is now up to all holders to decide whether to accept. We now hope that our support of the offer will play its part in the future success of the bank under the innovative hybrid structure which enshrines co-operative values while providing sound governance and access to capital markets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The campaign was started in June in response to requests from hundreds of pensioners and retail investors who were concerned about the future of the bank, and the impact the proposed exchange of their bonds into equity would have on their income. The number of retail investors registered with the campaign quickly grew to around 2,500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The majority of these are pensioners in their 70s, 80s and 90s who acquired Co-op Bank bonds for pension income," says Taber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge now will be getting all these people to vote and securing the necessary majorities. The bank is keen for people to get their vote in by 29 November at the latest. The deadline is 6 December, but the terms of the offer are more favourable if enough investors participate by the earlier date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've got to get them through the gate. That's the logistical operation that's under way," says Niall Booker, the bank's chief executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bosses warn that if the rescue fails, and the bank were to enter into a bank insolvency or administration procedure, "holders of relevant securities would receive no recovery at all".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all of this going on, it's perhaps not surprising that the Co-op Bank has been losing out in the battle to attract customers switching current accounts. It said there had been a "material reduction" in the number of people moving their accounts to it since the seven-day switching service was introduced in September, but insisted it had not seen huge customer outflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has also stated that the Co-op group's ethics and values would be "legally embedded" in the bank's constitution, and protected on an ongoing basis by an ethics committee of the board with an independent chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These "articles of association" cannot be changed without the support of the Co-operative Group. If whoever was running the bank in future were to ditch the wording about ethics, they would no longer be entitled to use the Co-operative name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Euan Sutherland, chief executive of the Co-operative Group, has refused to criticise the hedge funds, describing them as "very economically rational people" who were investing in the bank because they believed it could become profitable again. He said the bank had lost its way during the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, at least 50 branches are to be shut and a "significant" number of jobs will go – though the bank had already embarked on a branch closure programme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/banks"&gt;Banks and building societies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/ethical-money"&gt;Ethical money&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/co-operative-group"&gt;Co-operative Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking"&gt;Banking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/financial-sector"&gt;Financial sector&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/bonds"&gt;Bonds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/rupertjones"&gt;Rupert Jones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Some customers will see their rate halved after the largely state-owned RBS decided some Isa customers are enjoying returns that are "unsustainable in the current market".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there is good news for a further 1.9 million RBS/NatWest cash Isa holders – they will shortly benefit from a rate increase of up to 1%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the next few days, 3 million customers will start to receive letters confirming whether they are a winner or a loser as a result of the banking giant's decision to "simplify" its range of accounts by moving everyone with an older cash Isa on to a single product. But don't just sit back; instead, use the opportunity to review your Isa holdings and, in some cases, to switch to a better-paying account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cash Isas have been around for 14 years, but many savers are unaware they can transfer their Isa while retaining its tax-free advantages. Too many people simply open an account and forget about it, only for the interest rate to dwindle to nearly nothing. Transferring your funds, however, is easy. But be aware that some cash Isas don't allow transfers in from existing Isa accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, RBS/NatWest cut the number of cash Isa products on sale, so each brand now has just one: Cash Isa (NatWest) and Instant Access Isa (RBS). These variable rate accounts pay 1% to new customers who invest between £1 and £24,999, and 1.5% on £25,000-plus. Now the bank is looking at its older Isa accounts which are no longer available to new customers. It is ditching seven of these (including Cash Isa Plus, e-Isa and RBS's 60 Day Isa) and moving customers on to either a Cash Isa or Instant Access Isa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Crawford, RBS's head of savings, says that the majority of customers "will benefit in some way". Some people, for example those with more than £25,000 in RBS's 60 Day Isa, will see their rate jump from 0.5% to 1.5%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howeer, 1.1 million people will see a reduction in their rate when the changes take effect on 31&amp;nbsp;January. For example, the e-Isa pays up to 2.25%, while Cash Isa Plus pays 2% from £1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the bank is awarding an interest bonus of 0.3% for six months to its "most loyal and valuable customers". Another positive is that all restrictions attached to some of the older accounts – for example, some could only be operated online – are being removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So where should you transfer to at the moment? The highest rate cash Isa deal is from &lt;strong&gt;Virgin Money&lt;/strong&gt;, paying 3%, but it comes with a hefty lock-in until 2018 (or lose six months' interest when withdrawing).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best shorter term fixed Isa, pegged for two years, comes from &lt;strong&gt;Britannia&lt;/strong&gt;, with the rate set at 2.05% until the end of October 2015, but it's only marginally better than the 1.91% Virgin Money pays on its one-year Isa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are happy with a variable rate Isa, which may (but is not guaranteed) to rise if the Bank of England puts up rates, then consider the 1.8% deal from&lt;strong&gt; Kent Reliance &lt;/strong&gt;and the 1.75% deal from &lt;strong&gt;Virgin Money&lt;/strong&gt;. The NS&amp;I deal at 1.75% looks attractive, but it won't accept transfers in, while the Post Office's 1.8% rate is also at the top of the table, but after 18 months drops to 0.9%. Don't forget to keep all balances held at one institution below £85,000, as this is the&amp;nbsp;compensation limit if the worst happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/isas"&gt;Isas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/savings"&gt;Savings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/banks"&gt;Banks and building societies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/royalbankofscotlandgroup"&gt;Royal Bank of Scotland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking"&gt;Banking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/savings-rates"&gt;Savings rates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/rupertjones"&gt;Rupert Jones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/patrickcollinson"&gt;Patrick Collinson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The neighbours help out, and her son and daughter, in their late 50s and early 60s, do their best but live some distance away. Maureen will soon be going into a care home. The house will be sold – a four-bedder that will fetch around £350,000 – and her savings and state pension used to finance her nursing home costs. If she survives for any length of time, most of her assets will be used up and the son and daughter will inherit almost nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people regard this as a scandal. A life spent working hard, paying taxes, even fighting for your country, and then you see it all whipped off you. You are punished for thrift and left impoverished in a nursing home by a society that has lost its compassion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But let's take a reality check. Down the road from Maureen live Phil and Maxine, both in their late 30s, who have three children. They are paying a huge sum on their £250,000 mortgage, the only way they can afford a decent family home in the area. Every month it's a fight to keep afloat financially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scandal is not that Maureen's home and savings will be taken off her. Where else would the money go? If her nursing home bills were entirely picked up by the state it would be Maureen's "children" – two adults who have paid off their mortgages and are about to retire – who would be awarded nearly £200,000 each when Maureen dies. What warped sense of social justice sees Phil and Maxine paying taxes to cover Maureen's costs, just so her adult children can scoop a mini-jackpot?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our cover story this week features Ted Beales and his son's fight to obtain free "NHS continuing healthcare". It's difficult not to have sympathy, given his father's extreme condition. What's more, if the NHS is going to offer this scheme in England and Wales but then makes it virtually impossible to obtain (unless you have good lawyers), it should stop kidding people it's there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucial to the debate around care home costs is the idea that homeowners scrimp and save to build up the equity in their property, ony to have it stolen off them. Really? Maureen's £350,000 house cost £13,000 when purchased 40 years ago. The rest has been unearned inflationary gains. Did the family who rented a home over the same period and "earned" nothing from the property market work any less hard?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I bought my own home in south London seven years ago it has "earned" more than I have from working at the Guardian over the same period. If I lived in Hull it would have "earned" nothing. Yet millions of people are gripped by the idea that these unearned inflationary gains should be protected by other taxpayers, and passed on free of tax to their (adult) children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the last election there was a hysterical campaign to abolish inheritance tax, "the hated death tax" according to the Daily Express, "the Labour death tax" according to the Daily Mail. There were some interesting &lt;a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171776_333036.pdf" title=""&gt;figures last week from the Office for National Statistics&lt;/a&gt; that expose just who this campaign was really on behalf of: the already very well-off. Only 3.6% of people inherited a sum above £1,000 between 2008 and 2010. Over half of them picked up less than £10,000, and nine in 10 were below £125,000. Hardly a penny of that would have been taxed under the then-prevailing IHT rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is that the vast majority of inheritance falls into very few hands. In those two years, £57bn of the total £75bn in inheritances went to adults who were already in the top quintile of the population. Make no bones about it, campaigns to cut inheritance tax have one purpose: to protect the very wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Major&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; in his first speech as leader of the Conservative party, envisioned a society with wealth &lt;a href="http://politicalquotes.org/node/38680" title=""&gt;"cascading down the generations"&lt;/a&gt;. Instead we have a society where the progressive reduction of death duties means that wealth congeals rather than cascades, with all that means detrimentally to enterprise and entrepreneurship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My own philosophy is that individuals, where able, should work hard, accumulate savings, pay taxes and help the less fortunate, and use their savings to enjoy retirement and pay for care. There is no glory in bequeathing wealth to someone who did not earn it, and no shame in not leaving a penny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;• Names and details have been changed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/inheritancetax"&gt;Inheritance tax&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/tax"&gt;Tax&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/retirement-planning"&gt;Retirement planning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/older-people"&gt;Older people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/death-and-dying"&gt;Death and dying&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/family-finances"&gt;Family finances&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/patrickcollinson"&gt;Patrick Collinson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

When he wasn't pruning his roses, he would be at church meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in May this year he suffered a major stroke that left him unable to swallow, speak or stand. I flew back from my home in Thailand to see him – but rather than spending quality time together I soon found myself embroiled in a fight with the NHS to protect his savings and the family home, a three-bed bungalow in Clacton, Essex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I arrived back in the UK, the local healthcare trust wanted a meeting to discuss whether my father, a widower, qualified for "NHS continuing healthcare". This is a little-known scheme where the NHS covers all the costs, including board and accommodation for someone in a care or nursing home. It is a package that is, in the official lingo, arranged and funded solely by the NHS for individuals who are not in hospital who have a "complex medical condition and substantial and ongoing care needs".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But despite making contributions all his working life, and his obvious needs, it turned out the NHS felt my father wasn't ill enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he was moved into a nursing home, bills for £2,000 a month arrived – and the prospect that his savings could be seized became real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet his needs are clear: he cannot swallow, so a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) has been attached to his stomach, through which medicine and nutrients are supplied. His speech is so poor it is impossible to communicate pain or any basic needs. When he was assessed he could only move his left arm and leg (he can move his right leg very slightly now but that actually creates more problems: he was trying to get his one good leg out of bed when I visited last week, so he's at risk of falling). He'd contracted MRSA in hospital. It is hard to tell how much he understands what is going on. He is doubly incontinent. The list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the healthcare trust meeting, a senior nurse and social worker went through a checklist of needs. My father scored "serious" or "severe" in most categories but, as the meeting closed, the nurse told me she didn't think he had qualified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took a moment to register what this meant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first there was a feeling of shock that the health trust was apparently willing to wash its hands of him when he was so blatantly in need of medical help. This feeling was soon replaced by one of determination to fight for his right to receive help from a system he had always assumed would be there when he needed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My father lied about his age to join the army – he served with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders for about seven years and spent time in Palestine on a peacekeeping mission after the second world war ended – and later worked as a council gardener for more than 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the nurse's recommendation had been made, there was a panel meeting with the North East Essex Clinical Commissioning Group, where I presented my case. It listened politely, nodded sympathetically and, a week later, told me that my father had not qualified for continuing healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I opened the letter while surrounded by removal boxes – the family home was having to be cleared to make way for tenants. After a series of platitudes, the health trust's document said my father's needs were mainly "social and personal". If you saw him, you may consider that's like saying all that Nelson Mandela requires is a cup of tea and a cuddle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My father, now 87, is in a nursing home in Clacton. An appeal against the decision could take up to a year to be heard. For the time being, much of the £2,000 a month nursing home bill is being paid out of my salary and savings (I'm head of English at an international school in Thailand and a travel writer for Lonely Planet; I don't have any siblings). My father's pension should cover about half, but I've only just been granted power of attorney so I'm waiting for some paperwork to come through before I can access it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he had to go into a nursing home, he does receive NHS-funded nursing care – £109.79 a week for 2013/14 – and he has just been given an attendance allowance of £79.15 a week. Meanwhile, the only practical thing left to do is to let others know the potential pitfalls of falling ill under the NHS. To that end, I've set up a Facebook group called Give Ted a Bed to highlight the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With hindsight, there were more things we could have done. When he was well, he could have signed his property over to someone else. But make sure you stay well … get sick within six months and the transfer can be blocked. And if you remain in the house you will have to pay the full market rent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He could have transferred his savings elsewhere and, again, kept his fingers crossed he remained fit for six months afterwards. He could also have taken out critical illness insurance, but he is a proud man who drove, cycled and swam until his mid-80s, and the thought of monthly payments based on a "what if?" scenario would have seemed pointless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now he lies in his room most days and tries to speak. Sometimes you can make out a word or two; usually you can't. While I was trying to explain to him, in simplistic terms, that the NHS didn't think he was ill enough to help, he opened his blue eyes wide, looked straight at me and, I'm pretty sure, mumbled: "Bloody cheek."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• North East Essex Clinical Commissioning Group told us: "We can confirm we fund all cases that meet eligibility for CHC [continuing healthcare] funding. It is a statutory requirement. Excluding children the CCG spends over £14.7m in north-east Essex annually on CHC, with a year on year increase in numbers of cases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/family-finances"&gt;Family finances&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/healthcare"&gt;Healthcare industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/health"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

You know, that aeroplane that kept falling out of the sky in the 1950s because the metal got tired. This one – &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03h8r3y" title=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cold War, Hot Jets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (BBC2) – is better, though, at least once I'd got over my disappointment that it wasn't about debauched 1960s hot-tub parties. It's less about the metal, more about the world that the Comet was born into (and&amp;nbsp;fell out of). Aeroplanes and history: a dream combination. And not just the Comet: E.28/39s, Gloster Meteors, Vampires, U2 spy planes …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're talking postwar, when Britain was leading the world in aeronautical engineering. We kept bringing out faster and faster planes, and the cold war only sped everything up. A few test pilots were killed – quite a lot, actually – but it&amp;nbsp;was different back then, you jolly well&amp;nbsp;just did it. When John Derry's prototype DH.110 broke up and &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/witness/september/6/newsid_4219000/4219540.stm" title=""&gt;crashed at Farnborough air show in 1952&lt;/a&gt;, killing 31 people, Derry included, they &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHj0FOkcE94" title=""&gt;just cleared up the mess, then got on with the show&lt;/a&gt;. Imagine that now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then Rolls-Royce went and sold their engines to the Russians. Stalin promised they wouldn't copy them, but he lied; they did, then put them in their own MiG15 fighters. A bit like Arsène Wenger selling Robin van Persie to Manchester United: it made no sense at all. Anyway, the Russians cared even less about their pilots than we did, didn't even give them ejector seats, meaning MiGs were lighter and therefore faster than what the British were building. That, and the fact that our Comets began to fall out of the sky, rather put an end to our brief and glorious period of ruling the skies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was fun while it lasted. As is military historian James Holland's rip-roaring documentary about it all. Complete with&amp;nbsp;stirring patriotic music and a ride in a vintage plane for James. Plus some splendid old chaps, some of whom actually flew these machines and lived. It's even got Krushchev's son! Pundits don't get any classier than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/documentary"&gt;Documentary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/military"&gt;Military&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/culture/television"&gt;Television&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/samwollaston"&gt;Sam Wollaston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Three years on, we look at how he has performed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years ago maverick City multi-millionaire Terry Smith launched an investment fund promising easy, cheap and profitable investing for all. The boxing-mad son of a London bus driver said he would give the "fat and complacent" fund management industry a bloody nose. Three years on, he has amassed £1.5bn in the fund from more than 9,000 small (and some large) investors – and has managed to keep his promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An investor who put £1,000 into the fund, called Fundsmith Equity, when it opened in November 2010 will have seen it grow to £1,612 on its third birthday – a gain equal to 17.3% a year. That compares to the 7-8% a year earned by the average fund and puts Terry Smith in fourth place out of 244 in the "global" sector, where the underlying cash is invested in a range of shares from across the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His secret? Run a portfolio of just 20-25 stocks (the typical fund has 60 or more), invest for the long term (rival funds buy and sell their holdings on average every seven months, incurring high dealing costs) and focus on large, well-established companies which make their money through small, repeat, predicable everyday events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do not seek to find tomorrow's winners – rather, to invest in companies that have already won such as Colgate, Unilever and Domino's Pizza which are already in dominant positions in their respective sectors. We are encouraged that the average company in our portfolio was established in 1901 and survived two world wars and the Great Depression," says Smith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping fees down is crucial, he says. "I launched Fundsmith three years ago because I believed the fund management industry was broken. It is still broken. Investors continue to suffer from punitive fee structures, over-complexity, overtrading, fund proliferation, closet indexing and over-diversification."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too often, he says, investors believe that the standard 1.5% annual management charge is all they are paying but, in reality, they also have to pay for dealing and research costs, which, over time, can seriously eat into their returns. He says his fund pays commission to stock dealers of only 0.04% – and that, in any case, he doesn't trade in and out of shares very often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We seek to minimise portfolio turnover costs by only ever investing in good companies that we would be happy to own indefinitely."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His most profitable investment has been Domino's Pizza, which in November 2010 was trading at $15.15 a share, but is now above $68 – and is still good value, reckons Smith. Yes, anyone can make a pizza, he says, but no one matches Domino's for delivery. Indeed, in June the firm tested a drone, dubbed the "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=on4DRTUvst0" title=""&gt;DomiCopter&lt;/a&gt;," to deliver to a customer's door by air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of his major holdings are familiar household names, such as Microsoft, Reckitt Benckiser (makers of Harpic, Cillit Bang and Durex, among others) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group. But two of his other big holdings – Stryker and Becton Dickinson – will be more familiar to doctors and nurses. Stryker, based in Kalamazoo in Michigan, is the world's biggest maker of replacement joints for hips and knees, while Becton Dickinson, based in New Jersey, makes more needles and syringes than anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, two of the funds that have done better than Smith over the past three years have also been big investors in medical equipment, benefitting from an ageing population and new demand from emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was this a lucky call by Smith, which won't be repeated? Smith points out that medical equipment makes up around 18% of the fund, while the "consumer staples" stocks, such as Reckitt Benckiser, make up 45%. As important has been his decision to shun large parts of the stock market, including banks, insurance, property, housebuilders, oil, mining and resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mining and resources have been about the worst place for investors in the past three years, and Smith says that even after hefty falls, the stocks are too risky to buy. "We're not into global resources. My car can't tell one petrol from another. There's no brand value. We also want to buy companies that can last for ever; every resource company has issues about depletion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The books of the banks are still difficult to read, he says, and that comes from someone whose ability to see through a set of accounts is legendary. The same goes for insurance companies "whose accounts are almost the definition of opaque", he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will investors continue to reap returns of 17% a year? Smith says his portfolio of companies is in good shape, but he does not share the recent optimism about an economic turnaround in the UK or even the US, and reckons China is the biggest debt bubble in world economic history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm a pessimist on the economic outlook. I closely follow 75 worldwide companies, and another 175 in the next layer down. The vast majority of these are currently showing revenue growth that is significantly slower in the last six months than in the same period a year earlier. Things are getting worse more than they are getting better. I don't think there's actually a recovery. Statistics, such as purchasing managers indexes, have been somewhat bent out of shape, and are no longer particularly meaningful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He points to a &lt;a href="http://www.morningstar.com/earnings/earnings-call-transcript.aspx?region=USA&amp;t=KRFT&amp;pindex=2" title=""&gt;statement last week by the boss of Kraft Foods&lt;/a&gt; (a stock he does not own), who warned that the only place where sales were rising was in America's equivalent of Poundland (called Dollar stores); that people are falling out of the workforce; and that many US consumers have "minimal ability to buy more than what they need for a given week or sometimes a given day". The economic and financial crisis remains far from over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/investmentfunds"&gt;Investment funds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/moneyinvestments"&gt;Investments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/investing"&gt;Investing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/financial-sector"&gt;Financial sector&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/patrickcollinson"&gt;Patrick Collinson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

You could be left with a large bill: research by comparison site Gocompare.com found that half of all insurance policies do not cover damage to a vehicle while it is in the control of valet parking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gocompare.com reviewed 233 comprehensive car insurance policies and found that valet parking was excluded by 49% of policies. Scott Kelly, Gocompare's head of car insurance, said: "Valet parking, once the preserve of Hollywood movies, is becoming a popular option in the UK with many airports, major hotels and entertainment venues now offering 'meet and greet' services. Valet parking is a convenient way to park your car, especially at airports where it will save you having to drag heavy luggage on to a car park shuttle bus, but you need to consider the implications for your car insurance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some valet parking companies claim drivers are covered by their own insurance. But Gocompare said the terms and conditions offer little peace of mind. "Generally operators offer very limited cover for damage to your car, which you will need to spot and report to them on collection, and possessions left in your car are generally excluded."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet and greet parking services generally cost little more than the price of 10 days in a long-stay car park, but although many people are happy with the service, it is a business plagued with horror stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This summer, BBC1's Your Money, Their Tricks programme tested six different services at three major airports. Each car was fitted with a tracking device which told the programme's investigators whether it actually went to the car park that was promised and, crucially, whether it stayed there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Heathrow, the service was precisely as advertised. But at Gatwick, the tracking device found that the car, although initially taken to a secure car park, was 24 hours later driven to a residential address in Crawley – which the programme makers said appeared to be the home of the company's employee. Later, it was returned to the car park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other car in Gatwick, and the two in Luton, were taken to compounds that the programme makers alleged were not secure sites monitored by CCTV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/car-insurance"&gt;Car insurance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/insurance"&gt;Insurance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/motoring"&gt;Motoring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/consumer-affairs"&gt;Consumer affairs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/consumer-rights-money"&gt;Consumer rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/patrickcollinson"&gt;Patrick Collinson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Make sure you check with your GP about vaccinations and save hundreds of pounds compared to costly last-minute private clinics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travel insurers are warning that too many holidaymakers are failing to get vaccinated – and that an insurance policy won't pay out if they then fall ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost one in four British holidaymakers does not get vaccinated before going abroad, despite travelling to areas that have life-threatening infectious diseases, according to the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for travel insurer Direct Line said that although it considered claims on a case by case basis, "it is true that it could invalidate your policy if you contract a tropical disease and have not had the required innoculations before travelling".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A claims specialist at insurer More Than added: "We would not cover any expenses incurred as a result of a tropical disease if the policyholder has not had the recommended innoculations and/or taken the recommended medication."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that travellers crossing through parts of Africa and South America, perhaps on a gap year, won't be let in to some destinations unless they have a yellow fever vaccination certificate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first step before travelling is to call or visit your GP, who will give free, up-to-date information on the vaccinations required and check your records to see if your UK jabs are up to date. Ideally, check with your GP eight weeks before travelling, as some vaccinations take that long for the whole course of doses to be given. But if you decide to travel at the last minute, still take advice – even one jab from a course will give you more protection than none.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Free advice is also available at NHS website &lt;a href="http://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/home.aspx" title=""&gt;fitfortravel.nhs.uk&lt;/a&gt;, where there are details of immunisations needed for specific countries and up-to-date malaria maps. Also look at the National Travel Health Network and Centre website at &lt;a href="http://www.nathnac.org" title=""&gt;nathnac.org&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href="http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/travel/vaccines_index.shtml" title=""&gt;netdoctor.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your GP or practice nurse can give you a booster to your UK jabs if you need one and may also be able to give you travel jabs. It is up to individual GP services whether to offer travel jabs – some may refer you to a specialist travel clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is you may not have to pay for any of the innoculations. Vaccinations against polio (given as a tetanus, diphtheria and polio booster), typhoid, cholera and the first dose of hepatitis A are all free. Many GPs also do not charge for the second (booster) dose of hepatitis A or the combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For other vaccinations, such as meningococcal meningitis, hepatitis B, yellow fever, rabies, tuberculosis, Japanese encephalitis and tick-borne encephalitis, the NHS says you're likely to have to pay but adds that GPs can choose not to charge you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We mystery-shopped one GP surgery, and found that we would be charged £40 for rabies, £55 for Yellow Fever and £85-90 for Japanese encephalitis, but all other innoculations were offered free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can get travel vaccinations (and malaria tablets) at private clinics, some of which offer walk-in services, which may appeal if you do not want to wait for GP appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We compared costs for travel vaccinations at four private clinics: the UK Travel Vaccination Service &lt;a href="http://www.travelvaccination.co.uk" title=""&gt;travelvaccination.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;, which has clinics in London and the home counties, West Yorkshire and the West Midlands; Masta &lt;a href="http://www.masta-travel-health.com" title=""&gt;masta-travel-health.com&lt;/a&gt; which has 51 clinics around the country; Nomad Travel &lt;a href="http://www.nomadtravel.co.uk/c-4-travel-health-clinic.aspx" title=""&gt;nomadtravel.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; with health clinics in London, Bristol, Cardiff, Manchester and Bishops Stortford; and Trailfinders' walk-in London clinic &lt;a href="http://www.trailfinders.com/travelessentials/travelclinic.htm" title=""&gt;trailfinders.com&lt;/a&gt;, and found that prices varied significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/travelinsurance"&gt;Travel insurance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/insurance"&gt;Insurance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/consumer-affairs"&gt;Consumer affairs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/travel/healthandfitness"&gt;Health and fitness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/health"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jillpapworth"&gt;Jill Papworth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But there are big pitfalls&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visit any one of a number of online property investor forums and there's one subject dominating conversations: lease options. The deals are touted as a one-stop solution for struggling homebuyers and "motivated" sellers, but chiefly as a way for property investors to exploit the market and expand their portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But anyone thinking of getting involved should know that these deals are totally unregulated and that vulnerable homeowners may lose their home and still be responsible for the mortgage. The Financial Conduct Authority warns against lease options, as does the Council of Mortgage Lenders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lease options are also known as "rent-to-buy" or "rent-to-own". The idea for struggling homeowners, and people wanting to get on the property ladder, is superficially attractive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's say the owner has to sell because of a divorce, or because their job has relocated to another part of the country, but the market in their area is slow. Let's also say we have someone who is renting but is keen to buy, but can't afford a deposit. You bring the two together with a lease option. The divorcee moves out, and the tenant moves in, and takes over the cost of the mortgage on the property. The new tenant is given the choice (the lease option) to purchase the property, at a pre-set price, during or at the end of a certain period, usually around three to four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tenant – or more likely, an investor who then goes and finds a tenant – pays an "option fee" upfront to set up the deal. This can be as little as £1, which has led to some lease option companies declaring to potential investors they can "buy a house for £1".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A middleman, usually a property investor, sets up the deal and takes a cut of the option fee, rent, and a "back-end" payment when the option is exercised. The contracts are often promoted to buy-to-let investors as a quick way of growing their portfolio, allowing them to control a property without actually investing any money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Property investor and trainer Mark I'Anson, who claims investors can make £10,000 a month from following his techniques and speaks at &lt;a href="http://dominateyourground2.eventbrite.co.uk" title=""&gt;£350-a-ticket seminars&lt;/a&gt;, describes the deals as "a tool for retail investors to control an asset to produce profit".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The basic idea is to make a small profit (payment) for managing the property for an agreed length of time by renting it out. The profit is the difference between the outgoing mortgage payment, maintenance plus usual property expenses, and the incoming rent," he says, "A price is agreed for a possible future sale of the property and the potential buyer gains exclusivity of the purchase for an agreed time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ben Rogers is another promoter of lease options, who sells "insider secrets" to "buying houses for £1" and describes himself as "&lt;a href="http://benrogersproperty.com/members/get-access/" title=""&gt;one of the UK's niche experts in this way of controlling property for profit&lt;/a&gt;". He says: "We normally sell to people who want home ownership and can't afford a mortgage now, or don't qualify for one. Also, self-employed people who can't get a mortgage, or people that need time to qualify for a mortgage or save for a deposit. The beauty of it is that the buyer is fed up paying dead rent to a landlord where they have no control or security about the property. This way they can decorate or put a new bathroom in."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rogers makes it sound like a win-win situation but one of the main concerns about lease options is that they are completely unregulated, which paves the way for inexperienced or unscrupulous investors to target naïve renter-buyers and desperate sellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The major risk to a homeowner entering a lease option is that the renter/investor stops paying the mortgage. Under a lease option, the name on the mortgage is not transferred, and if payments stop, the original homeowner is still liable for the debt. The BBC's 5Live Investigates programme &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15290940" title=""&gt;featured one couple&lt;/a&gt; who agreed to a lease option, only to face repossession and additional debts of £30,000 after the mortgage was not paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martyn Morgan, solicitor at QualitySolicitors Talbots, says lease options are generally frowned upon by lawyers and the Law Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is a very dangerous process, particularly for sellers, to grant options to investors to buy a property. The title and mortgage remain in the names of the sellers, so if there is any default on repayment of the mortgage, the seller will be pursued for payment," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nigel Rowley, managing partner of solicitors Mackrell Turner Garrett, says lease options can work for some people but warns there are unscrupulous companies who market the deals to the desperate and those who see little hope of getting on to – or off –&amp;nbsp;the property ladder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Owners accept the promises that tenants will be put in, and that the original mortgage will be paid. But how do they know it will?," he asks. "How do they know whether the property is, in fact, being properly looked after, the mortgage properly paid, tenants in occupation etc. They don't – until it is too late."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's worth pointing out that lease option advertising tends to be similar to that for quick house sales, an area of the market the Office of Fair Trading is currently investigating. Typically, lease option firms offer "100% of the market value" – but this means today's market value not the market value when the deal completes in X number of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Financial Conduct Authority has lease options on its radar while mortgage experts have warned that most will be against the terms and conditions of most mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When they say you can buy a house for £1 with no mortgage and no credit checks it rings alarm bells. It's a large financial commitment and the investor has no personal investment, which makes me very wary," says Stephen Smith, housing director at Legal &amp; General. "Homeowners would need their mortgage lender's permission for this kind of deal and I doubt they'd give it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sellers agreeing to lease option deals arguably have more to lose than buyers. If house prices rise they're likely to regret agreeing a price at the time the option was taken out. If prices fall there's a risk the buyer or investor will not exercise their option to buy, and they'll still be stuck with the property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buyers, meanwhile, might pay a high rent for years then find, when the time comes to exercise their right to buy, they still can't get a mortgage and they've wasted their money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'Anson argues that every party in a lease option should do due diligence on the company they are dealing with. He says a reputable lease option company will have a recognised complaints process, indemnity insurance and a data protection licence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A few simple steps will keep everyone a little safer; as an industry, we have to act as if we are regulated and that's the most professional way to be," he says. "If the company you're dealing with doesn't carry all of the above I'd suggest staying away and finding one that does."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/property"&gt;Property&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/mortgages"&gt;Mortgages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/renting"&gt;Renting property&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/emma-lunn"&gt;Emma Lunn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

However, it's possible that some of them could have been eligible for "NHS continuing healthcare" – aka, fully-funded NHS care or NHS CHC – where the NHS covers all the costs, including care home fees. One of the big problems is that anyone exploring the world of long-term care will soon find themselves immersed in a bewildering alphabet soup of jargon and acronyms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is this? I've never heard of it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;You're far from alone. Under this scheme, some people in care homes have their healthcare and personal care costs met, plus their care home fees, including board and accommodation, without their other assets – such as a home or savings – being taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"NHS continuing healthcare is free, unlike social and community care services provided by local authorities for which a charge may be made, depending on your income and savings," explains the health service. There is no ceiling on the amount that can be paid and no means test. It is not age-related (you must be over 18).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It sounds amazing ... &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;It is if you can get it. If you're thinking of applying, you should prepare for a long, drawn-out battle, as you'll probably be turned down initially. As the Rolls-Royce of care packages, the eligibility criteria are very strict – it's only for those who are not in hospital but have a "complex medical condition and substantial and ongoing care needs", says the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The individual must have what's known as a "primary health need", which means their main or primary need for care must relate to their health. There are no specific conditions that automatically qualify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does it work?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; First, an initial screening is carried out, after which the local "clinical commissioning group" (CCG) will write to confirm whether or not the individual will be referred for a full assessment (CCGs took over responsibility for this area from primary care trusts in April this year. Your GP practice will be a member of a CCG).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are turned down at this point, you have the right to ask the CCG to reconsider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If and when you get to a full assessment, this will rate the individual's level of need in a whole range of areas, from mobility to continence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's an arcane system; put bluntly, the more "priority", "severe" and "high" ratings someone gets, the more likely they are to be eligible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that a decision that someone is eligible can be overturned later if their condition is judged to have improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if I'm rejected?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you want to challenge the decision, there's a two-stage process: a local review managed by the CCG, and an independent review panel. If all that fails, you can take your case to the &lt;a href="http://www.ombudsman.org.uk" title=""&gt;Health Service Ombudsman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What other help is there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you don't qualify for NHS continuing healthcare but live in a nursing home and have been assessed as needing care from a registered nurse, you should receive &lt;a href="http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/what-is-nhs-funded-nursing-care.aspx" title=""&gt;NHS-funded nursing care&lt;/a&gt;. With this, the NHS makes a payment directly to the nursing home – in England for 2013/14 the rate is £109.79 a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you aren't entitled to NHS continuing healthcare, or NHS-funded nursing care, the NHS may still pay for part of your care. This is sometimes known as a &lt;a href="http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/not-eligible-for-nhs-continuing-healthcare.aspx?CategoryID=68&amp;SubCategoryID=681" title=""&gt;"joint package of care"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no charge for the NHS part of a joint package of care, but local authorities can charge for the services they provide – and most do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the current system, if someone has a care need, their local authority will assess their income and assets to work out how much they should contribute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In England, if someone goes into residential care, their "housing assets" will also be taken into account, and they will continue to pay for their care &lt;a href="http://www.nhs.uk/CarersDirect/social-care/Pages/funding-your-care.aspx" title=""&gt;until they only have £23,250 left&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that point they may receive some local authority help with care costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But aren't things changing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes. The Dilnot report on long-term care recommended a universal deferred payment scheme to reduce the number of older people forced to sell their homes to pay for care. Councils would pay the costs and recoup them once the house was sold, usually after the person in care had died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there were &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/oct/15/downing-street-agrees-review-elderly" title=""&gt;claims last month&lt;/a&gt; that this scheme would not be available to anyone who had assets, on top of the value of their home, of more than £23,250.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lord Lipsey, a Labour peer, told peers that the original scheme put forward by Dilnot had "had its balls cut off by the government in the consultation document … If you have more than that, you have to spend down until you have £23,250 left, and then you can consider a deferred payment scheme".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Guardian reported that, in response, Downing Street had indicated the government may be willing to show some flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prime minister's spokesman said it was consulting on the proposal that those with assets of £23,250 above the value of their home should be exempted from the cost deferral scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you have assets above £23,000 you don't get the state coming in and giving you support. That is why the £23,000 figure is in the consultation … It is the starting point because it is currently the means test threshold."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where can I find out more?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are lots of sources of information out there. Try the website of charity Age UK, which has loads of factsheets including a 45-page (!) one on &lt;a href="http://www.ageuk.org.uk/Documents/EN-GB/Factsheets/FS20_NHS_continuing_healthcare_and_NHS-funded_nursing_care_fcs.pdf?dtrk=true" title=""&gt;NHS continuing healthcare and NHS-funded nursing care&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/family-finances"&gt;Family finances&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/consumer-affairs"&gt;Consumer affairs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/healthcare"&gt;Healthcare industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/health"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/rupertjones"&gt;Rupert Jones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It's greeted with a laugh, but nevertheless, you can see why he's chosen to revisit the concept of his 2001 album Swing When You're Winning. It's not merely the fact that – surprisingly – it's his biggest-selling album to date. Williams isn't really thought of as an artist who's hugely influential, but Swing When Your Winning genuinely was influential. After it went platinum seven times over, having an album-length crack at the Great American Songbook became de rigueur for a certain kind of artist: Rod Stewart ended up unleashing five of the things on a defenceless world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Williams launched Swing When You're Winning with a concert at the Royal Albert Hall, a number of critics waspishly noted that his attempt to recreate an air of Rat Pack-ish sophistication bore a closer resemblance to a 1970s light entertainment special than anything that went on in the Copa Room Sands Hotel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time around, a light entertainment special seems to be the aim: the concert that launches Swings Both Ways features Williams duetting on Something Stupid with not Nicole Kidman, but The Muppets' Miss Piggy, performing High Hopes with a group of children in school uniform, and bringing his dad onstage to rapturous applause. Instead of I Will Talk and Hollywood Will Listen, – a rather brittle Williams-penned number from Swing When You're Winning that ruminated on the vast stardom in America that everyone in 2001 seemed to think was a foregone conclusion but turned out to be anything but – the original material includes a song called No One Likes a Fat Pop Star, which he sings clad in a hugely padded suit, suspended over the circle on wires, while being admonished by a group of extras dressed as Victorian urchins. Rather than a sombre reading of It Was a Very Good Year, we get Williams singing I Wanna Be Like You surrounded by dancers dressed as monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To say that the show tends towards camp is to run the risk of understatement, something that clearly has no place in a show that at one juncture features Rufus Wainwright bursting out of a glittery closet wearing a pink lamé suit and matching top hat while singing, "Robbie, you're a little bit gay."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's all riotously entertaining, although you do find yourself wondering how much of the actual album you could stand to listen to without the accompanying visual extravaganza. The best of his new songs is an authentically charming ode to his 18-month-old daughter, Go Gentle, but more characteristic of what's on offer is a version of Minnie the Moocher with the lyrics altered so they're about Williams: "I'm the okey dokey Stokey blokey, a little bit tubby, a little bit cokey".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if nothing else, it all seems like evidence of a new-found contentment on Williams's part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the height of his fame, he always seemed oddly dissatisfied: it was hard to avoid the feeling that despite the millions of records he sold, what he really wanted was critical approval, a certain cachet, and that he was stung by the suggestion that there was something of the end of the pier about him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A decade on, he doesn't seem to be embracing the end of the pier so much as being fired from it out of a cannon in a hail of glittery confetti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether multi-platinum album sales will be forthcoming once more is questionable, but the Christmas TV audience for whom the show is being filmed seem likely to lap it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rating"&gt;Rating: 4/5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/robbie-williams"&gt;Robbie Williams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alexispetridis"&gt;Alexis Petridis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The court of appeal ruled that the role both banks played in a global manipulation of the London interbank lending rate (Libor) was relevant to individual cases brought against them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision was seen as a test case, the result of which could prompt more companies to bring action against banks, citing manipulation of Libor, which governs the price of financial contracts worth more than $300tn (£192tn) around the world. In previous rulings, judges had stopped short of saying Libor was relevant to all claims against banks and allowed it to be used only in cases where contracts have been linked specifically to the benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays is being sued for up to £70m by Guardian Care Homes, a UK residential care home operator, which alleges the bank mis-sold it interest-rate hedging products based on Libor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank is being counter-sued by India's Unitech after the bank brought legal action against the property firm last year for the repayment of a $150m loan and a related $11m interest-rate swap. Unitech said the loan and swap deal were linked to Libor interest rates, which at the time were being manipulated by some banks. Both cases are expected to go to trial next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The banks wanted the links to Libor to be excluded from the cases, saying Libor rates were not central to the original legal debate that inspired each case and that claimants were attempting to use the scandal to divert attention from the core issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank said it was disappointed by the judge's decision and would launch an appeal. Barclays said the allegations it faced were without foundation. "With or without the Libor claims, the allegations of mis-selling have no merit," the British bank said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/libor"&gt;Libor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/barclay"&gt;Barclays&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking"&gt;Banking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/deutschebank"&gt;Deutsche Bank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
